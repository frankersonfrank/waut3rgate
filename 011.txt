[Preface] I get paranoid and start saying stupid shit. Maddox hates Madcucks. Maddox claims Dick doxxed him.

[2017-01-29 13:35:18] <wauterboi> I don't want Jesse fucking with me.
[2017-01-29 13:55:42] <Maddox> I haven't talked to Jesse about you. Have you leaked our conversations?
[2017-01-29 13:57:04] <Maddox> It looks like you're fanning the flames man, why would you attack me like that? Would you think it was funny if someone was hurting your livelihood and I mocked you in public for it? That's not cool.
[2017-01-29 14:10:50] <wauterboi> Give me a second I'm driving, but I was attacking the troll not you. I knew it was someone from Jessie camp and they keep f****** with us.

[Note] Fuck Google's text to speech man. The word is "fucking", not "f******"

[2017-01-29 14:11:55] <wauterboi> I referred to our conversations indirectly in the chat room but I don't imagine you would think that's an issue
[2017-01-29 14:12:15] <wauterboi> Whatever this guy has as evidence I probably wouldn't have a problem with
[2017-01-29 14:12:56] <wauterboi> However I have to tell you if I have to self you might get caught up in the crossfire as much as I don't want. So is Jesse is planning on f****** with me I would suggest that you tell him not to
[2017-01-29 14:13:21] <wauterboi> I'm aware that you're not his controller or is owner or whatever but this is coming from your side now
[2017-01-29 14:18:11] <Maddox> It's not my side man, I don't control anyone. I haven't talked with Jesse about any of this. I don't tell Jesse, Jessica, Rucka or anyone I work with what to do. And that includes Asterios. If Jesse brings you up, of course I'll ask him not to fuck with you, but please don't fan the flames. Why would you mock me for the sponsors like that? That's not cool man
[2017-01-29 14:18:57] <Maddox> This is 100% coming from Dax. He's encouraging people to send screenshots for more "hot goss." He wants to continue this. I have still not said a single tweet or mention of him on my podcast
[2017-01-29 14:19:18] <Maddox> The dick warts took away Jesse's livelihood, I can't imagine that he's just going to sit back and take it
[2017-01-29 14:19:30] <Maddox> The more the push, the more this will keep going. I'm not fanning these flames.
[2017-01-29 14:19:59] <wauterboi> Jesse took away Jesse's livelihood. He created a fake Patreon in Madcucks' name and doxxed him.
[2017-01-29 14:20:10] <wauterboi> He sends his fans to fuck with him.
[2017-01-29 14:21:53] <wauterboi> And, for the record, I said it's cool you're getting more views but you need sponsors to stay afloat. that isn't me saying "haha Maddox sucks" but just stating the truth. And it was just to shoot these stupid troll posts down.
[2017-01-29 14:22:13] <wauterboi> I've been in defense of you if you look at my other reddit posts.
[2017-01-29 14:22:22] <wauterboi> People have associated me with that.
[2017-01-29 14:22:25] <Maddox> Dude, "Madcucks" attacks and mocks me and Jesse responds to it... do you see how this started? Why is there a person obsessed with mocking me? How do you not see that Dax started this whole thing?
[2017-01-29 14:22:50] <Maddox> Why can't they just leave me alone?
[2017-01-29 14:23:28] <Maddox> No more "hot goss," no more leaked conversations, no more madcucks. Dax started attacking me from the get-go. I still haven't attacked him. I haven't said a single fucking thing about him except for that video, which only came as a response to 4 months of him lying about me.
[2017-01-29 14:23:29] <wauterboi> Madcucks is allowed to make fun of you. People just aren't allowed to harass you.
[2017-01-29 14:23:43] <Maddox> That's true
[2017-01-29 14:23:46] <Maddox> He's allowed to make fun of me
[2017-01-29 14:23:51] <Maddox> and people are allowed to make fun of him
[2017-01-29 14:24:40] <Maddox> He's pretending to be me and made a Patreon for it, so Jesse thought it would be funny to make a patreon pretending to be someone pretending to be me. That's not why Jesse's patreon got shut down though. It was because of the n-word bullshit that was behind his pay wall and that he apologized for.
[2017-01-29 14:24:41] <wauterboi> And Jesse can make fun of me. If it comes to addresses and numbers being posted, I'm gonna respond and I'm not omitting anything. I'm going to report and get things shut down.
[2017-01-29 14:25:02] <Maddox> Well if someone posts your personal information, you should definitely report it
[2017-01-29 14:25:11] <Maddox> I don't think it's cool to dox people, which is why I haven't done it
[2017-01-29 14:25:29] <Maddox> But you're hanging out with the guy who constantly "doxes" me: Dax. He encourages his users to "dox" me (according to your defintion)
[2017-01-29 14:25:31] <wauterboi> Yeah. I know.
[2017-01-29 14:25:50] <Maddox> So it's bound to come your way too man. You're in the snake pit, you're going to get bit eventually. They're messing with fire
[2017-01-29 14:25:53] <wauterboi> Oh, and that I know. I was talking to him about all this. I'm now down for it
[2017-01-29 14:25:58] <wauterboi> *not
[2017-01-29 14:26:10] <Maddox> Thank you
[2017-01-29 14:26:18] <wauterboi> I think the always be trolling page is bullshit, and so is the "hitting the dog when it misbehaves" stuff.
[2017-01-29 14:26:55] <wauterboi> If it's just making fun of you, I don't care. But it is easy for that to go too far and be way more heinous.
[2017-01-29 14:27:09] <Maddox> No, it's not just "making fun of" me
[2017-01-29 14:27:11] <Maddox> It's slander
[2017-01-29 14:27:20] <wauterboi> That's what I'm saying.
[2017-01-29 14:27:20] <Maddox> He's releasing private financial information. That's doxing
[2017-01-29 14:27:24] <Maddox> He's encouraging his fans to harass amazon
[2017-01-29 14:27:27] <Maddox> That's harassment
[2017-01-29 14:27:35] <Maddox> He's calling my girlfriend a bitch on the air. That's harassment
[2017-01-29 14:27:40] <Maddox> He's attacking my livelihood
[2017-01-29 14:27:43] <Maddox> That's harassment and abuse
[2017-01-29 14:27:51] <Maddox> He's a bad person dude. This is only coming from him.
[2017-01-29 14:27:54] <Maddox> I'm not doing any of it.
[2017-01-29 14:28:15] <wauterboi> I didn't create that website for just you. :P
[2017-01-29 14:28:27] <wauterboi> The stuff I put on there for dick I totally believe.
[2017-01-29 14:29:07] <Maddox> Yeah, again, I thanked you for it, but you consulted only dick warts and Asterios for it
[2017-01-29 14:29:20] <Maddox> it had zero input from me or my fans. Madcucks and Asterios don't speak for me.
[2017-01-29 14:29:40] <wauterboi> Yeah.
[2017-01-29 14:30:19] <wauterboi> Oh, just for the record, even though it doesn't mean much
[2017-01-29 14:30:26] <wauterboi> The chat likes your last video
[2017-01-29 14:32:34] <wauterboi> And I think the idea of people liking you again isn't a lost cause or anything even though you don't want these people back. But it does make a case for people leaving you alone.
[2017-01-29 15:23:04] <Maddox> Thanks

[Note] At the time I totally wanted to believe that Dick was poking the bear and the bear overreacted. In hindsight, no, that's stupid. Dick was trying to get a dialogue out of Maddox because Maddox is not confrontational. Furthermore, Maddox tried to corner Dick by saying he screwed up the finances for TBPITU. Dick did the only thing he could do - prove himself. He didn't release sensitive data. He did it the best way possible.

I also believed that Dick should tell the fans not to do certain things, but by doing that wouldn't he be accepting responsibility for what other individuals do? And he's supposed to stop people from hurting the guy that got him kicked out of UCB?

But really, I accentuated these things so that Maddox could see me as an individual, not a "dick wart". And I was still in major denial about how I felt about Maddox.
