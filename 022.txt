[Preface] FRIENDSHIP ENDED WITH MADDOX, NOW DICK MASTERSON IS MY BEST FRIEND

[2017-05-15 12:28:50] <wauterboi> I'm sorry, but we can't be friends. I'm sticking to my guns on this one. You've gotta apologize to Dick. I don't believe you're moving on from it. I'll be around if you ever apologize to him about things, but for the time being I know that you originally had a twenty minute video to smear Dick with and your four minute video got him ripped away from a lot of comedic opportunities plus UCB. And you've also talked to me and others about how you could destroy Dick, Asterios, and 80's Girl's career. I have reason to believe you did actually suggest using coke as some sort of leverage against Dick, and I don't think it's cool. I can't just act like these things aren't as bad as they are anymore, or just agree to disagree.
[2017-05-15 12:35:13] <Maddox> I haven't done anything wrong and don't have anything to apologize for. Peace.
