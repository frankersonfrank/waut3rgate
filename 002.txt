[Preface] I stopped following Maddox on Twitter and YouTube just because I genuinely stopped enjoying his content. It didn't have anything to do with Dick. He came to me after noticing I'm not following him.

[2017-01-01 13:31:20] <Maddox> Wow... you unfollowed me?
[2017-01-01 14:28:05] <wauterboi> Yeah. Not too big on your new content. No offense, of course.
[2017-01-01 14:30:48] <wauterboi> I pretty much purge everything regularly of stuff I don't interact with. On Facebook I unfriend people I don't talk to every month. On YouTube and Twitter it's similar. It isn't a big deal to me, and I still gander at your Twitter every now and then.
[2017-01-01 14:40:31] <wauterboi> You okay? I don't want ya to feel hurt or anything.
[2017-01-01 15:05:51] <Maddox> Just sucks man. I feel like you've swallowed a false narrative that's out there. I wish you luck
[2017-01-01 15:07:50] <wauterboi> Like I've said before, I've got criticism for everyone. There's no sides or anything to me. I've got things I can say about everyone, but I also see it as me being too distant for any of these things to really matter. And most importantly it really is just about content. The new podcast takes a different direction that I think tickles other people's fancies and it's just not my thing. No biggy.
[2017-01-01 15:09:29] <wauterboi> I mean, if I were to see anyone in person and the opportunity came up, I'd open up about it, but I'm just a guy who plays around on a keyboard in Vegas for fun while attending college. I ain't really big enough to have an opinion that is worthwhile.
[2017-01-01 15:10:02] <wauterboi> You do you!
[2017-01-01 15:31:59] <Maddox> I thought of you more than a fan because we met, but no worries man. Hope all is well
[2017-01-02 04:28:46] <wauterboi> To be fair, I don't recall you following me on here and I don't take offense to that. It's fine. In my interactions with you, you've been a nice dude. So, to me, I consider you a buddy. I'd hang out with you if I weren't stuck here in Vegas. I've got friends who are content creators who do their own thing that I don't consume because I don't like their content. That doesn't mean I dislike them, of course. And with you, I just wasn't into your newest few videos or your new podcast. Despite the fact that there are people that want your head on a stick, I'm not one of them and I maintain apathy towards the drama. Like I said previously, there's no reason for me to involve myself, and I don't think my opinion on such matters would be seen as valuable. And I'm not bothered by that either.

[Note] Would appreciate someone checking to see if this code still works. Don't know if he bothered redeeming.

[2017-01-02 04:31:08] <wauterboi> If you would like, I released an album today and I've got a code for you to use to get it for free. Skip the last couple tracks if you like. hx42-u5wk

[2017-01-02 04:34:21] <wauterboi> If you wanna keep in touch or you've got some work for me to do, I'm down.
[2017-01-02 04:46:02] <Maddox> I don't follow anyone back because of my Maddox schtick, nothing personal of course. Congrats on the album release. Keep in touch. Later
