[Preface] Some of my messages I will omit. It goes over my mental health and issues with my entire family. It's dark. I would like to be transparent but in this instance it's too much. I am in a better place now, so no need to worry.

There is a chance that anyone else with the chatlogs may retaliate and uncensor these messages, which will undoubtedly just make them look terrible.

[2017-02-01 23:05:40] <wauterboi> I'm cool with helping out with moderation
[2017-02-02 01:27:19] <Maddox> I think you left before, but the warts were in full-on harassment mode by the end of the stream
[2017-02-02 01:33:56] <wauterboi> I did.
[2017-02-02 01:34:12] <wauterboi> I opened up vim and started programming
[2017-02-02 01:34:27] <wauterboi> Like I said, if you want me to moderate, I can do so.
[2017-02-02 01:50:16] <Maddox> Thanks
[2017-02-02 01:50:20] <Maddox> that's pretty cool that you use vim
[2017-02-02 01:50:23] <Maddox> I use it for everything
[2017-02-02 01:50:47] <wauterboi> I just started using it two days ago. I was at retard speed, and now I'm at "learning" retard speed. But it's fun and feels more involved.
[2017-02-02 01:52:50] <wauterboi> I've peaked through the rest of the stuff just by skipping through and watching the chat and really it just seems like you need tighter moderation on there especially since you've got the two different communities going on there - one of which that doesn't like you. Lots of other streamers deal with this especially when it gets into stuff like clans or controversy. Doesn't have to be me, of course, but yeah.
[2017-02-02 02:02:49] <Maddox> they were coordinating raids from the facebook group...
[2017-02-02 02:03:05] <Maddox> My mods were doing as much as they could. It sucks...
[2017-02-02 02:03:10] <wauterboi> Do you know what's happening in the Facebook group right now?
[2017-02-02 02:04:09] <wauterboi> Since I've left it has gone so far out there that everyone is funding surgery for a transgender woman who is offering people a spin if they can give her the funniest joke in a weird ass contest.
[2017-02-02 02:04:30] <wauterboi> Even dick doesn't know what's going on in there and it's just nonsense. It's become shit 4chan.
[2017-02-02 02:04:36] <Maddox> wtf
[2017-02-02 02:04:48] <wauterboi> That's not to say you're wrong - I'm saying I actually agree that the Facebook group is cancer.
[2017-02-02 02:04:56] <wauterboi> And I will absolutely go on record saying that.
[2017-02-02 02:05:37] <wauterboi> The moderator, Dustin, is retarded. He just started pushing his shitty promo for some stupid monthly box thing.
[2017-02-02 02:05:57] <Maddox> ugh, man I don't know/care about any of that stuff heh
[2017-02-02 02:06:06] <Maddox> but there's still brigading going on from the warts to r/madcast
[2017-02-02 02:06:13] <Maddox> that's why Jesse and I don't promote it
[2017-02-02 02:06:29] <wauterboi> And someone challenged David Clegg, if you know him, to an actual real life fight with the offering of real tickets. These people are deranged.
[2017-02-02 02:07:47] <wauterboi> I'm saying that the Facebook group has surpassed sheer fandom of Dick and has turned into something else entirely with the worst kinds of people.
[2017-02-02 02:08:21] <wauterboi> (which is why I left after like two days very early on)
[2017-02-02 02:15:55] <Maddox> caught one of the reddit guys harassing too: https://www.twitch.tv/688as
[2017-02-02 02:17:18] <wauterboi> How?
[2017-02-02 02:18:50] <wauterboi> He says all he said was lol
[2017-02-02 02:20:07] <Maddox> why bother us? He's not a fan, he's there to intimidate, harass and insult. These aren't good people who are there to support. They're there to antagonize. The messages were deleted because he was banned
[2017-02-02 02:20:18] <Maddox> This is a persistent problem
[2017-02-02 02:20:29] <wauterboi> But all he said was "lol"
[2017-02-02 02:21:12] <Maddox> He's also the one who "doxed" me when I tried reaching out to him on reddit.
[2017-02-02 02:21:28] <wauterboi> How so?
[2017-02-02 02:21:40] <Maddox> he took screenshots of everything and posted it against my wishes.
[2017-02-02 02:22:05] <Maddox> He also said he wanted me to die
[2017-02-02 02:22:17] <Maddox> He said he hopes I kill myself. Real salt of the earth guy.
[2017-02-02 02:22:38] <wauterboi> That last one he copped to and he said he wouldn't have said it if he knew you were in the room. Doesn't make a difference, but yeah.
[2017-02-02 02:24:02] <wauterboi> He says he doesn't know what you're talking about regarding conversations.
[2017-02-02 02:24:35] <Maddox> Please don't share my conversations with you with him.
[2017-02-02 02:24:53] <wauterboi> Alright, I asked him though.
[2017-02-02 02:24:59] <Maddox> He's a liar
[2017-02-02 02:25:13] <Maddox> I have eyes and ears everywhere
[2017-02-02 02:25:18] <Maddox> He said he hopes I kill myself
[2017-02-02 02:25:37] <wauterboi> You mean Jesse and his guys in our IRC?
[2017-02-02 02:25:45] <Maddox> But then again, this is from the TDS reddit that has a suicide pool. ��
[2017-02-02 02:25:46] <wauterboi> And I saw.
[2017-02-02 02:26:10] <Maddox> These are bad people
[2017-02-02 02:26:46] <wauterboi> He said he hasn't done anything to you outside of parodying your 2016 shirt
[2017-02-02 02:27:19] <wauterboi> Unless there's a way to verify anything I can't accept that anyone is a liar.
[2017-02-02 02:27:39] <wauterboi> And I know about the suicide comment. It's shitty banter. I talked to him about it.
[2017-02-02 02:28:14] <Maddox> Saying it's "banter" is dismissive. It's a way to shirk responsibility and minimize the horrible things that are being said and done.
[2017-02-02 02:28:18] <wauterboi> 02:27 @_688as i just dont want him to think i'm trying to start shit with him

02:27 @_688as because i dont want him attacking this channel

02:27 @chub confirmed

02:27 @_688as same reason i've been staying out of all this jesse bullshit

[2017-02-02 02:28:43] <Maddox> Harassment = trolling. Suicide = banter. Rape threats = jokes. Rape list = one guy. When will it be enough for it to be a problem? When someone gets killed?
[2017-02-02 02:29:18] <wauterboi> I never said those rape threats were jokes.
[2017-02-02 02:29:24] <Maddox> Good
[2017-02-02 02:29:30] <Maddox> They're not jokes. My friend was put on that rape list.
[2017-02-02 02:29:44] <wauterboi> I said that people are individuals, and one doesn't reflect the many.
[2017-02-02 02:29:54] <wauterboi> Otherwise you have to include me in the many.
[2017-02-02 02:30:27] <wauterboi> All I've been saying is that things aren't as simple as you are making them out to be, and when you simplify you're basically blurring reality.
[2017-02-02 02:30:56] <Maddox> Well this isn't one instance. This is a pattern: violent threats against Asterios' ex-wife, rape list, death threats, suicide pool, harassment, stalking, messaging sponsors, Dustin's family getting death threats, etc, etc, etc.
[2017-02-02 02:31:17] <wauterboi> Yeah. And with that is its own shitty subgroup of scum of the earth.
[2017-02-02 02:31:27] <Maddox> People on TDS subreddit linked to Jessica's twitter calling her a "filthy whore"
[2017-02-02 02:31:43] <Maddox> Dax telling Ela to get AIDS and eat shit and film it
[2017-02-02 02:31:53] <wauterboi> Yeah, and if I saw that you'd see me in the comments saying they are shitty people.
[2017-02-02 02:32:01] <Maddox> Dax encouraging people to "dox" me by re-tweeting private conversations and offering a bounty for them
[2017-02-02 02:32:16] <wauterboi> I told Dick I don't like that.
[2017-02-02 02:32:23] <Maddox> Buddy
[2017-02-02 02:32:27] <Maddox> He doesn't care about you
[2017-02-02 02:32:29] <Maddox> He doesn't care about me
[2017-02-02 02:32:36] <Maddox> I was his friend of 10 years. Look at the way he treated me
[2017-02-02 02:32:45] <Maddox> See how badly he treats me now?
[2017-02-02 02:32:54] <Maddox> That's a glimpse of how awful he was even before the podcast ended.
[2017-02-02 02:36:53] <wauterboi> I don't know what to say. I don't think there's anything I can do to make you feel better. I don't think Dick is in the right but I also don't think he's in the wrong either. I think you put things in a very black and white context and say that I'm just rationalizing bad things. That's not what it seems or feels like to me.
[2017-02-02 02:37:38] <wauterboi> And even if there are bad things a person does, there is context, and there is reactions too. I don't agree with a lot of your reactions.
[2017-02-02 02:38:30] <Maddox> How do you not think what he's doing is wrong? He's attacking my livelihood. He attacked it even before I released that video. He slandered me for months. He lied and cheated. He continues to lie about me. He lies to the fans about the numbers he's getting (downloads at least), his fans manipulate the download ranks. I mean, this isn't one or two bad eggs, this is a community of people who stalk, harass, abuse and make threats. This is toxic. I don't know what it'll take for people to see that.
[2017-02-02 02:38:48] <Maddox> Before that video was released, I did *nothing* wrong to Dax other than not mention him in the final episode. That's it.
[2017-02-02 02:38:53] <wauterboi> I can tell you that 688as does not actually want you to commit suicide. It's an off color joke based on the fact that he thinks you've changed. Doesn't mean that it's a good joke. It's a shit joke. But it isn't flat out wanting you to commit suicide. There's more to it. He's not trying to get you to commit suicide.
[2017-02-02 02:38:53] <Maddox> Everything else he has told about me is a lie.
[2017-02-02 02:39:03] <Maddox> I haven't changed.
[2017-02-02 02:39:11] <Maddox> That's Dax's bullshit narrative to turn people against me
[2017-02-02 02:39:32] <wauterboi> That's an example of a bad thing that's still bad but is bad with context.
[2017-02-02 02:40:28] <Maddox> Well there seems to be a huge double standard because when Jesse makes an off-color joke and says the "n-word" followed by "just kidding, I'm sure Denzel is a good guy." The dick warts jump all over it not because they're offended, but because they're mean-spirited people who want to hurt people's livelihoods. They hurt mine, even though that show had nothing to do with my network.
[2017-02-02 02:40:30] <Maddox> How is that fair?
[2017-02-02 02:40:54] <wauterboi> Jesse hit first.
[2017-02-02 02:40:58] <Maddox> No
[2017-02-02 02:41:00] <Maddox> Dax hit first
[2017-02-02 02:41:04] <Maddox> Go listen to episode 12
[2017-02-02 02:41:12] <Maddox> Seriously, listen to it
[2017-02-02 02:41:17] <Maddox> He slanders me for 20 minutes
[2017-02-02 02:41:23] <wauterboi> Jesse had no reason to be involved. He threw a punch and got dealt with.
[2017-02-02 02:41:34] <Maddox> You want to talk about character assassination? He literally says that I "have no character." That's character assassination.
[2017-02-02 02:41:41] <Maddox> No, Dax hit Jesse first
[2017-02-02 02:41:47] <Maddox> And the dick warts are constantly harassing us
[2017-02-02 02:42:00] <wauterboi> How did dick hit first?
[2017-02-02 02:42:01] <Maddox> Seriously, join the madcast subreddit and see how much shit we have to put up with on a daily basis
[2017-02-02 02:42:07] <Maddox> The dick warts keep harassing us and Jesse fought back.
[2017-02-02 02:42:20] <wauterboi> Oh, I'm aware. I don't like it. It's why I offered to moderate.
[2017-02-02 02:42:25] <Maddox> I'm not saying everything he's doing is right or that I agree with it, but he's responding to harassment from the dick warts.
[2017-02-02 02:42:46] <Maddox> Go listen to episode 12
[2017-02-02 02:42:56] <Maddox> around the 20 minute mark
[2017-02-02 02:43:03] <Maddox> He lies about me constantly in that episode
[2017-02-02 02:43:10] <Maddox> slanders me
[2017-02-02 02:43:25] <wauterboi> That reminds me
[2017-02-02 02:43:26] <Maddox> says to his "life coach" that I never replied to him a single time since the show ended. That's a bald-faced lie.
[2017-02-02 02:43:46] <Maddox> He's obsessed
[2017-02-02 02:43:47] <wauterboi> Did you say that Dick was going to punch Larry in the face?
[2017-02-02 02:44:12] <Maddox> No!
[2017-02-02 02:44:20] <Maddox> I don't even know where the fuck this bullshit is coming from
[2017-02-02 02:44:23] <Maddox> Seriously this is insane.
[2017-02-02 02:44:26] <Maddox> He's lost his fucking mind.
[2017-02-02 02:44:43] <wauterboi> That wasnt dick. That was Asterios.
[2017-02-02 02:44:51] <Maddox> Asterios is full of shit.
[2017-02-02 02:44:58] <Maddox> Asterios, Larry and I have never been in the same room together
[2017-02-02 02:45:04] <Maddox> I've never said ANYTHING to Asterios about Larry
[2017-02-02 02:45:10] <Maddox> I didn't even know Asterios knew who Larry was
[2017-02-02 02:45:30] <Maddox> And want to know the truth about Asterios and my friendship? We've only hung out together solo maybe about 3-4 times
[2017-02-02 02:45:42] <wauterboi> He said that Larry was going to go on Madcast Media and you told him that Dick threatened to punch Larry in the face.
[2017-02-02 02:45:42] <Maddox> We weren't that close. He doesn't really know me.
[2017-02-02 02:45:56] <Maddox> woah, maybe... is he getting that from Dax?
[2017-02-02 02:46:03] <Maddox> Part of that is true
[2017-02-02 02:46:08] <Maddox> Larry was going to have a show on my network
[2017-02-02 02:46:25] <wauterboi> Asterios said all of that and he claimed to learn it from you
[2017-02-02 02:46:40] <Maddox> I could see Dax saying that to Larry tongue-in-cheek, but that didn't come from me. I never told Asterios anything about Larry. Asterios is a liar.
[2017-02-02 02:46:45] <Maddox> Asterios is a liar.
[2017-02-02 02:46:56] <Maddox> Asterios said he got doxed.
[2017-02-02 02:46:57] <Maddox> He didn't.
[2017-02-02 02:47:02] <Maddox> Hey that reminds me
[2017-02-02 02:47:17] <Maddox> If you think what Jess did to Asterios was doxing, do you think quoting someone is also doxing?
[2017-02-02 02:48:10] <wauterboi> Look, I said that under the specific definition Asterios is right. I also said he should have chosen a better word. I personally don't think it's doxxing but just shitty.
[2017-02-02 02:48:20] <wauterboi> Depending on the circumstances, of course.
[2017-02-02 02:48:36] <wauterboi> I'll quote people sometimes for clarity and convenience.
[2017-02-02 02:49:16] <wauterboi> I think Asterios is wrong for using that word but isn't a liar.
[2017-02-02 02:49:17] <Maddox> Do you think it's doxxing or quoting?
[2017-02-02 02:49:29] <wauterboi> Depends.
[2017-02-02 02:49:31] <Maddox> Because you just paraphrased me to 688as, did you just dox me? Or did you quote me?
[2017-02-02 02:49:46] <wauterboi> I quoted you.
[2017-02-02 02:50:04] <wauterboi> Or, actually I don't even know if I did.
[2017-02-02 02:50:17] <Maddox> well so what's the difference?
[2017-02-02 02:50:20] <Maddox> You took a private conversation
[2017-02-02 02:50:23] <Maddox> Without my permission
[2017-02-02 02:50:26] <Maddox> And shared it with people
[2017-02-02 02:50:33] <Maddox> So why's that quoting whereas what Jess did is doxing?
[2017-02-02 02:50:36] <Maddox> See what I'm getting at?
[2017-02-02 02:51:09] <wauterboi> Yeah. But do you see where I'm getting at by saying it's shitty for her to do?
[2017-02-02 02:51:17] <Maddox> Yes, I already admit it was shitty
[2017-02-02 02:51:32] <Maddox> Let's not go there again, I've acknowledged that it was shitty and wrong of her to do
[2017-02-02 02:51:34] <Maddox> But it's not doxing.
[2017-02-02 02:51:37] <Maddox> You realize doxing is illegal right?
[2017-02-02 02:51:49] <wauterboi> That's really been my point. He used a word that is normally used with a specific connotation but he went with a more general term.
[2017-02-02 02:52:01] <Maddox> No, doxing = illegal.
[2017-02-02 02:52:10] <Maddox> He martyred himself to make himself a victim go get money
[2017-02-02 02:52:13] <wauterboi> I wouldn't put it past Asterios to treat some things as sexual assault either.
[2017-02-02 02:52:16] <Maddox> Dax and Asterios are lying to make more money.
[2017-02-02 02:52:32] <wauterboi> He didn't have to use the word dox. It would have been equally effective IMO.
[2017-02-02 02:52:33] <Maddox> Follow the money.
[2017-02-02 02:52:46] <Maddox> Dude, why isn't this obvious to the dick warts?
[2017-02-02 02:53:00] <Maddox> They're fleecing you guys with bullshit stories about how they were victimized
[2017-02-02 02:53:08] <Maddox> I haven't done anything wrong to Dax other than not mention him
[2017-02-02 02:53:12] <Maddox> I haven't done anything wrong to Asterios
[2017-02-02 02:53:26] <Maddox> I have zero things to apologize for Asterios.
[2017-02-02 02:53:48] <wauterboi> Well, his motive is to get you to apologize to him.
[2017-02-02 02:53:53] <Maddox> hahahaha
[2017-02-02 02:53:59] <wauterboi> That's what he wants, according to our conversation.
[2017-02-02 02:54:01] <Maddox> he's out of his fucking mind. Apologize for what?
[2017-02-02 02:54:11] <Maddox> If he truly wanted an apology, he'd talk to me
[2017-02-02 02:54:14] <Maddox> He knows how to get a hold of me
[2017-02-02 02:54:24] <Maddox> Want to know the truth about Asterios? He's not such a nice guy
[2017-02-02 02:54:28] <Maddox> He threatened me with my book release
[2017-02-02 02:54:34] <Maddox> I told him I could threaten his livelihood too
[2017-02-02 02:54:38] <Maddox> He said "do it!"
[2017-02-02 02:54:41] <Maddox> I wouldn't
[2017-02-02 02:54:46] <Maddox> Because it doesn't make me feel good to go so low
[2017-02-02 02:54:49] <Maddox> But he threatened me
[2017-02-02 02:54:53] <Maddox> He's a scumbag.
[2017-02-02 02:55:12] <wauterboi> He feels betrayed partially because you wouldn't tell him who was leaking his conversations and you were putting someone else over him.
[2017-02-02 02:55:33] <Maddox> He's assuming I know who it was
[2017-02-02 02:55:34] <wauterboi> The bald eagle thing. He said he wanted to know who you shared his texts with.
[2017-02-02 02:55:57] <Maddox> Asterios is a mean son of a bitch, why would I share that information with him, even if I knew? So Asterios can attack and smear them in public like he's doing to me? Fuck him.
[2017-02-02 02:56:42] <Maddox> I'm not interested in protecting his reputation. He's two-faced. He talks behind his friend's backs.
[2017-02-02 02:56:53] <wauterboi> If you released stuff I sent you to someone else who then released it to the world I would be incredibly upset.
[2017-02-02 02:57:08] <wauterboi> I would think you are picking someone over me and that we aren't really friends.
[2017-02-02 02:57:43] <Maddox> I told you I don't know
[2017-02-02 02:57:47] <Maddox> But it could very well be one of my friends
[2017-02-02 02:57:59] <Maddox> and even if I knew, there's no way I'd tell Asterios, that mean-spirited asshole
[2017-02-02 02:58:02] <Maddox> Want to know something else about Asterios? Right before I released that video, I told him I was fed up with this bullshit and I was going to release a statement telling everything, and he said "do it!" He encouraged me to release that video. He even knew about Dax's rape statement. He said I should release it. So there you go.
[2017-02-02 03:00:05] <Maddox> hey man, can you please not share any part of these conversations with anyone ever again, unless I explicitly give you permission? I haven't shared anything you've told me with anyone, I think it's fair that I expect the same level of privacy from you
[2017-02-02 03:01:54] <wauterboi> Sure, although I don't really care if you share anything I say with anyone else. I'm nobody.
[2017-02-02 03:03:08] <wauterboi> I've vented a little bit in the past in regards to the Make Rage Not War thing by saying you really didn't like it but as far as I can recall that's all I've said.
[2017-02-02 03:03:59] <wauterboi> And it wasn't like "fuck Maddox" but "yeah my website isn't gonna fuckin work it was a dumb idea"
[2017-02-02 03:04:43] <Maddox> that's fine, if it was general like you're saying
[2017-02-02 03:04:50] <Maddox> And it wasn't a dumb idea
[2017-02-02 03:05:01] <Maddox> You were on the right track. It just has to be neutral and representative

[Note] Prepare for personal stuff.

[2017-02-02 03:12:13] <wauterboi> Off-topic, but I was just staring at my ceiling and I feel like I've grown very used to dysfunction and nothing really surprises me anymore. I think everyone I've ever met has been incredibly fucked up in their own way. I think the best word to explain how I feel is numb to it all.

[Note] It's a meme at this point, but I was genuinely in a bad state of mind. Super depressed and anxious, hating school, doing poorly in school. Severe problems in my family and extended family. That kind of a thing. I needed an outlet. And being in the position where you're seeing someone you look up to in complete disarray as he tries to convince you that the other person you enjoy is a terrible person just adds a special kind of negativity to it all. I am actively getting help now, though, so no worries.

[2017-02-02 03:12:29] <Maddox> hmm
[2017-02-02 03:12:33] <Maddox> interesting you say that
[2017-02-02 03:13:06] <Maddox> You know, I talked with a friend once who told me something interesting: my friend said, "if you find yourself dating and meeting the same types of people, you have to ask yourself, what is it about you that attracts these people to you?"
[2017-02-02 03:16:17] <wauterboi> Well, there's no doubt that I'm shitty in my own way. I personally have mental issues. The reality of the situation is I attract a lot of people that tell me the worst things about themselves. [unfortunate event] And there are people who, for very little reason at all, have told me that they were raped, or peer pressured into drugs. And I live around people who are nothing more than their escapes and problems.
[2017-02-02 03:16:27] <wauterboi> Nothing really surprises me anymore.
[2017-02-02 03:17:39] <Maddox> I'm sorry to hear that, must be a terrible burden for you'
[2017-02-02 03:17:46] <wauterboi> It's why I think you are wrong but I think it's wrong with context. You think you are right but that in itself doesn't bother me. Because I still think you are trying to be good. I don't think you want to hurt anyone.

[Note] D-E-N-I-A-L. J-U-S-T-I-F-I-C-A-T-I-O-N. T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E. Shame on me. He already said he will if he has to!

[2017-02-02 03:17:50] <Maddox> Do you wish people would be less sharing with you?
[2017-02-02 03:18:03] <wauterboi> No, I'm used to it, and I like learning.
[2017-02-02 03:19:09] <wauterboi> I hope you don't take that offensively, but it was just meant to reflect on how I think. Some people try to prove people wrong to dismiss them, but I think people are inherently wrong with life in general.
[2017-02-02 03:19:44] <wauterboi> I don't think you or I or others are invalid people, and that no matter what we do we will always be surrounded in misery. Life is suffering, etc.
[2017-02-02 03:19:48] <Maddox> Well look man, I'm not saying I'm "right" or wrong. I'm just explaining myself. I know I've done things to upset Dax. We had creative differences on the show, and those aren't "right" or "wrong." Those are differences of perspective. He has his philosophy and I have mine. I don't begrudge him for disagreeing with me as long as it's coming from a pure place. Where he did "wrong" and he crossed the line is by being unethical and misleading me into thinking we were still friends only so he could use me for money and to ride my coattails for publicity. And when he slandered me, and attacked my friends and my girlfriend and livelihood. That's unethical. That's wrong. That's not a matter of opinion or disagreement. That's just a shitty thing to do to someone, especially after I've done so much for him.
[2017-02-02 03:20:19] <wauterboi> I expect everything and everyone to break because it's human nature.
[2017-02-02 03:21:28] <Maddox> He wouldn't have his podcast without me. He wouldn't have been admitted into UCB without me. He wouldn't have met Randy without me. He wouldn't even have a girlfriend without me. He used me for everything he could and gave me nothing but hatred in return. Do you know how shitty that feels?
[2017-02-02 03:21:40] <wauterboi> I generally listen to people because I don't think many people will understand me. I end up boring many people, and the people I don't bore would assume I'm depressed.
[2017-02-02 03:21:48] <Maddox> I want you to take a moment to think about what I just said
[2017-02-02 03:21:52] <wauterboi> I understand your context and pain.
[2017-02-02 03:22:10] <Maddox> He wouldn't even have his fucking house
[2017-02-02 03:22:20] <Maddox> He's used me for everything he can and he's still trying to use me.
[2017-02-02 03:22:24] <wauterboi> [family situation] 
[2017-02-02 03:23:11] <wauterboi> [family situation] 
[2017-02-02 03:23:40] <wauterboi> [family situation] 
[2017-02-02 03:24:38] <wauterboi> [family situation] 
[2017-02-02 03:25:05] <wauterboi> I still love them all very much even though it causes a lot of pain for me.
[2017-02-02 03:28:17] <Maddox> I'm sorry to hear that, that's pretty rough
[2017-02-02 03:28:51] <Maddox> For what it's worth, I used to think that people mostly had good intentions in life. That's that phenomenon you noticed where people think they're trying to do good and just try to justify their philosophies
[2017-02-02 03:28:59] <Maddox> But honestly, dealing with Dax changed me
[2017-02-02 03:29:09] <Maddox> I no longer believe most people have good intentions. He definitely doesn't
[2017-02-02 03:29:10] <wauterboi> [omitted - depersonalization and derealization symptoms]

[Note] I don't experience those symptoms anymore. I'm in a better place.

[2017-02-02 03:29:38] <Maddox> Even Asterios, I don't like the guy, but I think he's messed up and doesn't know what he's doing. He's not truly evil, he's just selfish and fucked up. Dax on the other hand? Watch out. He's a bad egg
[2017-02-02 03:29:58] <Maddox> (go on, I'm listening)
[2017-02-02 03:29:58] <wauterboi> I would say there is a scale of narcissism. I'm very interested in stuff like cults for this reason. There's a reason why gears turn in a machine. Jonestown is my favorite example.
[2017-02-02 03:31:36] <wauterboi> If you look at all the cults, there's a lot of people who think they're doing a lot of good up until you get to the very top person who views people as chess pieces.
[2017-02-02 03:32:11] <wauterboi> I don't think that's unlike all of society. :P Dick could very well be that person. I don't have enough information to make that determination though.
[2017-02-02 03:33:12] <wauterboi> All I know is that these people exist, pain is not temporary, and the only way to live life is to accept it and suffer correctly so that it doesn't hurt so bad.
[2017-02-02 03:33:31] <wauterboi> (not that I'm addressing your predicament but in general)
[2017-02-02 03:33:34] <Maddox> Look man, I know him. I know him better than anyone. Asterios doesn't know him, even my ex (who he's dating) doesn't know him. I've known the guy for a decade. He's a bad person.
[2017-02-02 03:33:51] <Maddox> Look at how much suffering he's trying to cause us
[2017-02-02 03:33:57] <Maddox> And for what? A fucking comedy podcast?
[2017-02-02 03:33:57] <wauterboi> Yeah, I'm not really talking about that so much.
[2017-02-02 03:34:06] <wauterboi> I'm speaking very generally right now.
[2017-02-02 03:34:13] <Maddox> ah
[2017-02-02 03:35:21] <wauterboi> I guess the best way to put what I'm saying is I don't really hope anymore.
[2017-02-02 03:35:57] <wauterboi> I just thought it was a weird thought as I was staring at the ceiling. Everything will always be terrible but something I appreciate.
[2017-02-02 03:36:26] <Maddox> Don't lose hope man
[2017-02-02 03:36:31] <Maddox> There's lots to hope for
[2017-02-02 03:36:41] <Maddox> I think you struggle because you have hope, deep down somewhere
[2017-02-02 03:36:53] <Maddox> Want to know something?
[2017-02-02 03:37:00] <Maddox> I'm kind of like you... people confide in me a lot
[2017-02-02 03:37:05] <wauterboi> I think good things will come through influence.
[2017-02-02 03:37:06] <Maddox> Lots of people share their suffering with me
[2017-02-02 03:37:18] <Maddox> I've spoken to so many suicidal fans of mine
[2017-02-02 03:37:31] <Maddox> and have talked many off the ledge, and have become lifelong friends with some of them
[2017-02-02 03:37:40] <Maddox> Wanna see something? Please don't share this:
[2017-02-02 03:38:00] <Maddox> [omitted link; not comfortable reading people linking to the text page full of suicidal people thanking Maddox for his content]

[Note] If you've ever e-mailed Maddox and talked about being suicidal and enjoying his content, he keeps that in a text file with names/emails omitted in the HOME DIRECTORY OF HIS WEBSITE.

[2017-02-02 03:38:08] <wauterboi> Oh, I have read that.
[2017-02-02 03:38:18] <Maddox> Ohh, did I share it before?
[2017-02-02 03:38:24] <wauterboi> I don't remember how I got access. No.

[Note] I actually got access through a fan geocities(?) site that documented secret webpages on his website BACK IN MIDDLE SCHOOL. Maddox must be oblivious to this. That text file is STILL ACCESSIBLE EVEN AFTER LATER DRAMA REGARDING PUBLIC FILES IN HIS WEBSITE. IT'S NOT EVEN A HARD FILE TO GUESS.

If you do find this file (as of writing it was found within 3 seconds on IRC from someone typing in stuff in the address bar), I implore you not to share it because it's quite literally a listing of actually suicidal people's messages THAT HE STORES IN PUBLIC.

[2017-02-02 03:38:44] <wauterboi> I may have stumbled on it shoving shit in the URL bar.
[2017-02-02 03:38:57] <wauterboi> Because I used to do that in middle school bored out of my mind.
[2017-02-02 03:41:28] <wauterboi> [mental health] 
[2017-02-02 03:43:10] <wauterboi> I liked your problem with suicidal thoughts - it was my favorite episode from the podcast.
[2017-02-02 03:43:19] <Maddox> Thanks
[2017-02-02 03:43:25] <Maddox> the one about self-defeating thoughts?
[2017-02-02 03:43:29] <Maddox> episode 67?
[2017-02-02 03:43:32] <wauterboi> Yeah.
[2017-02-02 03:44:05] <wauterboi> Interestingly enough, my second favorite problem was virgin shaming not even because of that but because of Asterios.
[2017-02-02 03:45:02] <Maddox> episode 77
[2017-02-02 03:45:08] <Maddox> that was a good episode
[2017-02-02 03:45:16] <Maddox> Those were two of my favorites as well
[2017-02-02 03:45:21] <Maddox> 67 resonated with a lot of people
[2017-02-02 03:45:29] <Maddox> It was the most memorable episode for so many people
[2017-02-02 03:45:33] <Maddox> I wanted to do more episodes like that
[2017-02-02 03:48:57] <wauterboi> I apologize if I'm rambling nonsense, I just feel real clouded in my head right now which is kind of the problem. I deal with problems with disassociation. Everything around me feels like a movie set and surreal sometimes. Sometimes it doesn't even feel like I'm here, or I'm not typing this even.
[2017-02-02 03:50:40] <Maddox> Have you ever spoken with a therapist? Not to suggest you need to, but it could definitely help you get some more clarity
[2017-02-02 03:51:00] <Maddox> That disassociation you're feeling might be a sign that you're overwhelmed
[2017-02-02 03:51:14] <wauterboi> [mental health] 
[2017-02-02 03:51:28] <wauterboi> [mental health] 
[2017-02-02 03:52:14] <wauterboi> [mental health] 
[2017-02-02 03:54:58] <wauterboi> I just kind of reached the point where I think this is how it is. I just got the short end of the stick and it's alright
[2017-02-02 03:56:28] <wauterboi> Nobody is really entitled to anything. Not everyone gets a good life. And I live substantially better than a lot of people. I just have to deal with my head being off kilter.
[2017-02-02 03:57:15] <Maddox> How do you think your head is off kilter?
[2017-02-02 03:58:53] <wauterboi> Well, it depends on who is describing it. If it's me, I would say I'm very easily distracted and obsessive. I used to be incredibly over empathic as well which is not good when everything is turning to shit,I think. But I've got better at it
[2017-02-02 04:00:30] <wauterboi> I also think I'm just naturally depressive and anxious genetically. [symptoms] 
[2017-02-02 04:01:08] <wauterboi> [unfortunate event] 
[2017-02-02 04:03:39] <wauterboi> [unfortunate family history] 
[2017-02-02 04:05:03] <wauterboi> [unfortunate death within the family and things leading up to it]
[2017-02-02 04:05:27] <Maddox> Fucking a
[2017-02-02 04:05:34] <wauterboi> That's not the worst of it but I won't get into it. I think things are kind of better though
[2017-02-02 04:05:35] <Maddox> Do you live at home?
[2017-02-02 04:06:39] <wauterboi> I do, but I'm working on moving out with my girlfriend. I'm safe with my mom and my uncle's family right now. But people still fall apart. [unforunate history] I don't think there is really a way out. It's just life.
[2017-02-02 04:07:16] <wauterboi> [unfortunate family history] 
[2017-02-02 04:09:16] <wauterboi> [unfortunate accident that killed my friend in high school] 
[2017-02-02 04:09:46] <wauterboi> Nobody is owed anything in this life
[2017-02-02 04:10:11] <Maddox> Well look man
[2017-02-02 04:10:30] <Maddox> you can change things starting with you
[2017-02-02 04:10:40] <Maddox> I'm glad you're making positive steps
[2017-02-02 04:10:42] <wauterboi> I apologize for just rambling to you, I feel really disorganized in my head.
[2017-02-02 04:10:51] <Maddox> Some of it sounds bleak for sure
[2017-02-02 04:11:03] <Maddox> Wanna hear a parable that helps me get through tough times sometimes?
[2017-02-02 04:11:14] <Maddox> It's an explanation for why bad things happen to good people...
[2017-02-02 04:14:43] <Maddox> There was a student in biology who loved to collect butterflies. One day he found a cocoon and excitedly took it to his teacher, who said he should watch and nurse it patiently until it hatched. Finally the day came for it to hatch, and the boy patiently watched the larvae struggling to get out of its cocoon, and then he decided to help it along by cutting the cocoon open a bit. The larvae came out and died shortly after. He was distraught over the butterfly's death, so he took it to school and asked his teacher what happened. The teacher told him that because he helped the butterfly out of its cocoon, it didn't build the adequate strength to survive in the world (that's actually what happens if butterflies don't hatch on their own... they die if you help them).
[2017-02-02 04:15:33] <Maddox> Similarly, sometimes bad things happen to us and cause us to struggle so we can grow and strengthen to endure the tougher challenges that come in life. We need to go through this struggle to survive what else life has in store for us.
[2017-02-02 04:15:43] <Maddox> anyway man, hope you like that story. I've gotta crash
[2017-02-02 04:15:48] <Maddox> hang in there, it was good talking with you
[2017-02-02 04:15:59] <wauterboi> Night, thanks for talking with me.
[2017-02-02 04:16:03] <Maddox> sure thing
