[Preface] Jesse from the Madcast Media Network called a black friend of both Maddox and Dick the N-word. Asterios claimed Jessica "doxxed" him because she leaked his text-messages on Twitter.  Maddox put out a hit-piece on Dick Masterson claiming his fan base maintains a "rape-list" of females associated with either The Dick Show or Madcast Media because of an inactive 8chan board no one knew about. That video can be found here: http://maddox.xmission.com/c.cgi?u=what_really_happened_biggest (the password is supposed to be #DickLies but you can actually put anything you want.)

[2017-01-06 07:58:47] <wauterboi> So, you're probably getting a lot of flak for Jesse's slip up, but I think it's kind of piling up. He just called Denzel a nigger, he said some hateful stuff towards Brazilians, and he called someone fat and gay which he calls "a bad thing". Why stick around with the guy anymore?
[2017-01-06 07:59:36] <wauterboi> I'm asking out of curiosity, because I would perceive him as a threat to your brand.
[2017-01-06 09:59:29] <Maddox> Do you listen to Jesse's show?
[2017-01-06 10:09:14] <Maddox> Dax has done and said literally all of those things, except replace Brazilians with Mexicans, and "nigger" with "faggot." Only Brazilian isn't a race, it's a nationality. Anyone can become a Brazilian. Jesse was making a stupid joke as part of a long-running gag on his show. I disagree with it and I think it was unfair to attack Denzel. I spoke to Denzel about it and apologized to him, and so did Jesse. The only thing hurting my brand is Dax Herrera's constant slander of it and the dick warts harassing me, my sponsors and my livelihood.
[2017-01-06 10:10:03] <Maddox> Jesse's fans haven't put my girlfriend on a rape list. Jesse's fans aren't doxxing us. Jesse's fans aren't trying to take food off my table by harassing my sponsors. Dax and his awful fans are and have been for months, even before I released my video.
[2017-01-06 10:10:37] <Maddox> Enough is enough dude. Dax said that if a drunk girl passes out in a guy's bed, the guy who has sex with her isn't a rapist. Jesse has never said that.
[2017-01-06 10:11:03] <wauterboi> To be straight up with you, I'm a fan of The Dick Show, so when you address us as being responsible for a rape list it's really off-putting. I'm in the IRC channel too.
[2017-01-06 10:11:20] <Maddox> Ugh, dude are you sharing this conversation? Please don't

[Note] I don't recall actually sharing anything at this point. This is just Maddox's normal paranoia.

[2017-01-06 10:11:30] <Maddox> Can you give me your word you won't share this? Please?
[2017-01-06 10:11:37] <wauterboi> I'm not sharing this.
[2017-01-06 10:11:48] <Maddox> You promise?
[2017-01-06 10:12:04] <Maddox> I'm so sick of this. You guys are HURTING MY LIVELIHOOD.
[2017-01-06 10:12:34] <Maddox> Do you understand that dude? Nothing has happened to Dax. He has had zero consequences because I haven't gone after his livelihood like he has mine. He started it before the video was released.
[2017-01-06 10:12:55] <Maddox> And yes, his fans did make a rape list. And they put my friend on it. And my girlfriend. It's disgusting dude.
[2017-01-06 10:13:17] <wauterboi> How do you know that wasn't *one* person? You've had deranged fans in the past. That doesn't reflect you or your community.
[2017-01-06 10:13:32] <wauterboi> Dick nor most fans ever used that board. It was alive for less than a week.
[2017-01-06 10:13:44] <Maddox> How do you know it was one person? And even if it was, does it matter?
[2017-01-06 10:13:51] <wauterboi> Yeah it does.
[2017-01-06 10:13:58] <Maddox> Well it doesn't look like it
[2017-01-06 10:14:53] <Maddox> Because several people made a conversation on there. And I'm not sure if it's one of his fans or 10 of them, the fact remains that his fan(s) made a rape list and he and all the dick warts didn't delete it. Please tell Jessica that it's okay that she was called a "cum dumpster" who deserves to get raped and ditched in an alley that "don't worry, it's just one fan (maybe)!"
[2017-01-06 10:15:04] <Maddox> You don't have to listen to her sobbing next to me because people want to rape her
[2017-01-06 10:15:32] <wauterboi> What you're saying is if I created an 8chan board for your community and posted anonymously I can hold you directly responsible for it. And at the time of that post existing, Dick wasn't a moderator and none of us were even aware it existed.
[2017-01-06 10:15:47] <Maddox> No dude. I didn't say Dax was responsible for it
[2017-01-06 10:15:59] <Maddox> Dax has spun the story to fit his narrative.
[2017-01-06 10:16:05] <Maddox> In the video I said his fans created it. They did.
[2017-01-06 10:16:15] <wauterboi> But that's the thing - you're using it as a strong point of association. You're associating it with us fans, and then us fans to Dick.
[2017-01-06 10:16:36] <Maddox> Right, his fans are creepy as hell. They actually made rape threats against Jessica
[2017-01-06 10:16:41] <Maddox> What am I missing?
[2017-01-06 10:16:59] <Maddox> Asterios' ex-wife got death threats
[2017-01-06 10:17:05] <Maddox> His guest Lenore got rape threats
[2017-01-06 10:17:18] <wauterboi> I've received death threats all over the internet. I've had people track down pictures of me and post disgusting things. Mind you, these were on forums dedicated to Garry's Mod.
[2017-01-06 10:17:23] <wauterboi> Awful people exist everywhere.
[2017-01-06 10:17:32] <Maddox> Listen to yourself buddy
[2017-01-06 10:17:41] <Maddox> You're defending a fan base that makes RAPE THREATS AGAINST MY GIRLFRIEND.
[2017-01-06 10:17:56] <Maddox> You know what the only appropriate response is?
[2017-01-06 10:18:04] <Maddox> "Yeah, it's fucking disgusting. I'm sorry dude."
[2017-01-06 10:18:07] <Maddox> This isn't a joke
[2017-01-06 10:18:28] <Maddox> We went to the police. Rape is a direct threat. You can't make a rape list, even as a joke
[2017-01-06 10:19:05] <wauterboi> I'm defending people who *didn't* create it. I don't know who made it. Whoever made it is awful. Whoever participated it is awful. Labeling the entire fan base is awful and by doing so you're bunching *me* into it. That's the point I'm trying to make.
[2017-01-06 10:19:25] <Maddox> The fan base is awful man.
[2017-01-06 10:19:28] <Maddox> Look at what they're doing to me
[2017-01-06 10:19:39] <Maddox> Do you think they're good or kind or decent people who are trying to ruin my livelihood?
[2017-01-06 10:19:58] <Maddox> Do you think they're kind or decent people for making death threats against Asterios' ex-wife?
[2017-01-06 10:20:03] <Maddox> For doxxing people?
[2017-01-06 10:20:15] <Maddox> Jessica didn't dox Asterios. He's lying.
[2017-01-06 10:20:24] <Maddox> The only people who got doxxed are us and Kendal and Hyde
[2017-01-06 10:20:31] <Maddox> The fan base is truly awful.
[2017-01-06 10:20:45] <Maddox> You know dude, I've been doing this for 19 years
[2017-01-06 10:20:52] <Maddox> And NEVER has any of my fans made a rape list
[2017-01-06 10:21:17] <Maddox> His fans made one because he permits it. He has literally said a girl who gets raped should just "take a warm shower." And that a dude who rapes a girl in his bed "isn't a rapist, get over it."
[2017-01-06 10:21:22] <Maddox> Is that what you support?
[2017-01-06 10:21:40] <Maddox> Because I fucking don't. And I don't think it makes me an SJW to be against rape. My friend got raped a few months ago. I'm sick of it.
[2017-01-06 10:21:42] <wauterboi> I have no way to verify that, so it's not really something I care enough to process.
[2017-01-06 10:21:54] <Maddox> No way to verify what?
[2017-01-06 10:21:57] <wauterboi> That he said that.
[2017-01-06 10:22:03] <Maddox> Yes you do:
[2017-01-06 10:22:12] <Maddox> http://www.menarebetterthanwomen.com/rape/
[2017-01-06 10:22:27] <Maddox> "A guy who fucks a drunk girl who passed out in his bed isn’t a rapist, he’s just a dick. Get over it."
[2017-01-06 10:22:48] <Maddox> I didn't even know about that article when I made my video.
[2017-01-06 10:23:04] <Maddox> Again, please don't share any of this. I'm speaking just with you. I'm not interested in fueling the drama.
[2017-01-06 10:23:10] <wauterboi> I'm not going to.
[2017-01-06 10:23:14] <Maddox> Thank you
[2017-01-06 10:24:37] <wauterboi> For the record: I'm a feminist. I think I've talked with you about female representation in video games and other stuff. I've got rape victims in my circle of friends and in my family. I read this and I thought he was bending over backwards to be shocking and satirical, much like a Modest Proposal.
[2017-01-06 10:25:11] <wauterboi> In other words: it doesn't affect me. I don't like the article, but I don't have to.
[2017-01-06 10:26:05] <Maddox> It's not satire. He told me it's not satire in real life, the first day we recorded Biggest Problem. He wanted to do it as Dax Herrera because that's how we recorded the 6 pilot episodes. Then the last second he switched and we argued about it for 45 minutes, and I told him "the only way you can save yourself is if you call yourself a satirist." And he said "it's not satire because I really believe it."
[2017-01-06 10:26:31] <wauterboi> How do I verify that? How do I verify anything?
[2017-01-06 10:26:58] <Maddox> Even if you want to say it's satire, which it isn't because satire has to be making a point, and there's no point he's trying to make by defending a guy for rape.... but even if you do that, is it also satire to harass real women in real life, that aren't public figures like Ela Darling and my girlfriend?
[2017-01-06 10:27:07] <Maddox> Is it satire to tell Ela Darling to get AIDS?
[2017-01-06 10:27:18] <Maddox> And to tell her to eat shit and film it? Is that satire too? Against a REAL PERSON?
[2017-01-06 10:27:55] <wauterboi> Lots of people tell others to eat shit, get raped, etc.
[2017-01-06 10:28:04] <Maddox> That's not satire
[2017-01-06 10:28:05] <Maddox> It's abuse.
[2017-01-06 10:28:09] <wauterboi> It isn't satire, it's an insult.
[2017-01-06 10:28:35] <Maddox> So then when his fans jump on board and take his lead and make rape and death threats and take things too far, does he denounce it? Never.
[2017-01-06 10:28:46] <Maddox> When he sicked the job lynch mob after me, did he denounce it? No.
[2017-01-06 10:29:02] <Maddox> Put your sister or your mom or your girlfriend on a rape list and call it satire all you want, it's not. You don't know Dax. I do
[2017-01-06 10:29:18] <Maddox> Almost nothing he's said about me or the show's ending is true
[2017-01-06 10:29:26] <Maddox> Yet you don't seem to have the same double standards of verification for him
[2017-01-06 10:29:36] <wauterboi> He said that he doesn't advocate rape and that he thinks that the rape list is pretty vile.
[2017-01-06 10:30:02] <Maddox> I've proved that he said that a woman who gets passed out and drunk at a party "expects" to get raped. That means it's her fault. And he has doubled down on that assertion. What more do you want me to prove? You still support the guy
[2017-01-06 10:30:14] <wauterboi> I think his stories are entertaining but I don't put much thought into them. I'm pretty indifferent, once again. After all, I'm talking to you. I talk to Asterios. I talk to Dick.
[2017-01-06 10:30:18] <Maddox> Well not advocating rape and then saying that it's a woman's fault isn't compatible
[2017-01-06 10:30:25] <wauterboi> There's multiple sides to everything.
[2017-01-06 10:30:32] <Maddox> Yeah and you haven't heard my side
[2017-01-06 10:30:49] <Maddox> Asterios falsely accused Jessica of doxxing him
[2017-01-06 10:30:55] <Maddox> Do you know what happened after he did that?
[2017-01-06 10:30:57] <Maddox> She got doxxed
[2017-01-06 10:30:59] <Maddox> And rape threats
[2017-01-06 10:31:02] <Maddox> And death threats
[2017-01-06 10:31:04] <Maddox> They know what they're doing
[2017-01-06 10:31:15] <Maddox> They're doing it so their fans do it to harass us
[2017-01-06 10:31:19] <wauterboi> So is that what you're referencing with saying Asterios did something disgusting to you and your girlfriend?
[2017-01-06 10:33:31] <Maddox> That: he accused her falsely of doxxing him, and that got the dick warts to dox her and send her rape and death threats. They even contacted her clients and harassed them. Fuck all of this. Fuck him and fuck the disgusting fans who'd do that

[Note] I knew from this point forward what the mysterious thing Asterios did but didn't say anything for months because I hadn't jumped ship yet. Putting that out there would have killed any chances of communicating further.

[2017-01-06 10:33:36] <Maddox> It's only coming from one direction: Dax's camp
[2017-01-06 10:33:52] <Maddox> Want to know something? I'll show you something but PROMISE me you won't share it
[2017-01-06 10:34:06] <wauterboi> Sure thing, man.
[2017-01-06 10:34:34] <Maddox> Asterios hates Dax
[2017-01-06 10:35:05] <Maddox> [image: http://www.wauterboi.com/peen/003_asterios.jpg]
[2017-01-06 10:35:27] <Maddox> There's a small snippet of one conversation I had with Asterios, right before I stopped talking to him.
[2017-01-06 10:35:30] <wauterboi> sounds like he's trying to appeal to his peers.
[2017-01-06 10:35:31] <Maddox> Asterios thinks Dax is a sociopath
[2017-01-06 10:35:45] <Maddox> No dude. Asterios hates dax. He told me "dax is a bad person"
[2017-01-06 10:35:48] <Maddox> That's a direct quote
[2017-01-06 10:35:56] <Maddox> He said "Dax is going to be a footnote in your comedic career"
[2017-01-06 10:35:58] <Maddox> Direct quote
[2017-01-06 10:36:06] <Maddox> He said "Dax is jealous of you. He's a scumbag"
[2017-01-06 10:36:09] <Maddox> Direct quote
[2017-01-06 10:36:17] <Maddox> And he called him a sociopath and thinks Dax is psychotic
[2017-01-06 10:36:40] <Maddox> He's using Dax for money and Dax doesn't like Asterios. Dax wanted him banned from the old show. Now they're using each other to make money because they don't care about anything else.
[2017-01-06 10:37:43] <wauterboi> I dunno, man. I personally don't know what you would have to show me to get me to switch into "Fuck Dax" mode, but I'm also not in "Fuck Maddox" mode.
[2017-01-06 10:38:04] <wauterboi> There's no way to see if anything anyone is saying is truthful.
[2017-01-06 10:38:29] <Maddox> I'm not asking you to switch
[2017-01-06 10:38:43] <Maddox> But you seem to have made up your mind based on not hearing my side of the story
[2017-01-06 10:39:07] <wauterboi> What position do you think I've taken?
[2017-01-06 10:39:16] <Maddox> As have most of the dick warts, and part of the reason I haven't defended myself is because they're truly awful people. I don't want them back in my fan base. They're all trump supporters who make rape and death threats and nobody seems to denounce it
[2017-01-06 10:39:25] <Maddox> And now those fucking hypocrites are going after my livelihood
[2017-01-06 10:39:39] <Maddox> Well you seem to be a fan so you think Dax's behavior is okay
[2017-01-06 10:39:44] <Maddox> I don't
[2017-01-06 10:39:51] <Maddox> I don't want anything to do with the guy
[2017-01-06 10:40:00] <Maddox> You've gotta stick up for your principles man
[2017-01-06 10:40:05] <wauterboi> I listen to his content. I haven't hung out with him personally.
[2017-01-06 10:40:13] <Maddox> Right. I have
[2017-01-06 10:40:15] <Maddox> I'm telling you the truth
[2017-01-06 10:40:28] <Maddox> His own mom thinks that Dax Herrera is a character and Dick is who he really is
[2017-01-06 10:40:45] <Maddox> You saw that conversation he had behind my back, right? The one that ended the podcast?
[2017-01-06 10:41:10] <wauterboi> Yup!
[2017-01-06 10:41:25] <Maddox> Dax was one of my best friends. Do you realize how hurtful it was to read that he was using me for money? And he still is. The biggest draw to his show is still my name. He can't stop talking about me and slandering me. Do you think he's a good person? Do you trust someone who talks behind his friend's back like that?
[2017-01-06 10:42:20] <Maddox> The reason we're talking is because you're not one of them man. You're a good dude. I know you are. You're feeling cognitive dissonance because you know this doesn't add up. His fans are awful (not all of them of course, there are a few good ones), but he has done and said some really terrible things. And now me and Jessica and Ela and all my friends and family are suffering for it
[2017-01-06 10:42:54] <wauterboi> To be fair, you were talking to a lot of people on Twitter and Facebook about him - sometimes even using the official TBPITU page to say things.
[2017-01-06 10:43:12] <Maddox> No, I wasn't
[2017-01-06 10:43:22] <Maddox> Do you know how many tweets I sent about Dax after the podcast ended?
[2017-01-06 10:43:24] <Maddox> Guess...
[2017-01-06 10:43:38] <wauterboi> I'm talking DM's
[2017-01-06 10:43:45] <Maddox> No
[2017-01-06 10:43:57] <wauterboi> what about Ragethegod?

[Note] If you're not all about The Dick Show Goss(tm) Lore(c), Ragethegod leaked DM's from Maddox

[2017-01-06 10:44:14] <Maddox> Dude. That happened last month, and he's lying about some of that shit, and he PROMISED me not to share it
[2017-01-06 10:44:16] <Maddox> he gave me his word
[2017-01-06 10:44:31] <Maddox> I'm talking about before the video was released
[2017-01-06 10:44:38] <Maddox> How many tweets did I send about him?
[2017-01-06 10:45:00] <Maddox> I'm the victim here and I'm being made out to be like some fucking bad guy when I haven't done anything wrong.
[2017-01-06 10:45:14] <wauterboi> I don't recall any tweets, but I do recall seeing you post a comment with the TBPITU page. I saw it with my Facebook and was confused.
[2017-01-06 10:45:14] <Maddox> Not a single fucking thing. Dax is the abuser and I'm somehow the victim because he's taking advantage of my silence
[2017-01-06 10:45:33] <wauterboi> I don't know if you deleted the comment but it was saying Dax's mom thinks Dick is the real Dax.
[2017-01-06 10:45:34] <Maddox> Are you sure? I don't think so
[2017-01-06 10:45:44] <Maddox> Dude that was when I released the video
[2017-01-06 10:45:54] <Maddox> Of course I commented then. That's the only time I commented with that account.
[2017-01-06 10:45:57] <wauterboi> That's still really weird to do.
[2017-01-06 10:46:14] <Maddox> Why? You think it's weird to defend myself against lies?
[2017-01-06 10:46:21] <wauterboi> At the time I was just kind of scratching my head thinking, "Well, this is a thing now."
[2017-01-06 10:46:38] <wauterboi> I think it makes sense to do so with your Maddox account, but not on the account for the show shared by two people
[2017-01-06 10:47:05] <Maddox> It wasn't shared by two people. I created and maintained that group. He wanted nothing to do with it
[2017-01-06 10:47:15] <Maddox> In fact, that's why the podcast started to go down hill
[2017-01-06 10:47:18] <Maddox> I was doing 90% of the work
[2017-01-06 10:47:21] <Maddox> He wasn't doing anything
[2017-01-06 10:47:25] <wauterboi> It still represents the podcast.
[2017-01-06 10:47:50] <Maddox> So? He's been slandering me and fans of the show wanted to know the truth. You're telling me I can't defend myself?
[2017-01-06 10:48:00] <Maddox> I posted that on the FB page of the show
[2017-01-06 10:48:06] <Maddox> Not on my Maddox account
[2017-01-06 10:48:14] <Maddox> So I can't defend myself there
[2017-01-06 10:48:22] <Maddox> The only place I can defend myself is in that Facebook group
[2017-01-06 10:48:40] <Maddox> How am I supposed to defend myself when people are only commenting about it there?
[2017-01-06 10:48:42] <wauterboi> I'd say your Maddox FB page and Twitter makes sense.
[2017-01-06 10:48:51] <Maddox> Well I haven't tweeted it there
[2017-01-06 10:48:54] <wauterboi> Well, because it's one sided.
[2017-01-06 10:49:02] <Maddox> Dax's story is one-sided
[2017-01-06 10:49:02] <wauterboi> Dick doesn't have the ability to respond there.
[2017-01-06 10:49:07] <Maddox> Yes he does
[2017-01-06 10:49:16] <wauterboi> Your story is one-sided by default too :P
[2017-01-06 10:49:20] <Maddox> And by the way, I was responding to his bullshit, not his
[2017-01-06 10:49:25] <wauterboi> It's just one side being told.
[2017-01-06 10:49:33] <Maddox> Yeah, ONLY HIS
[2017-01-06 10:49:40] <Maddox> Well dude, that's fine, there are creative differences and there are 2 sides to those stories
[2017-01-06 10:49:43] <Maddox> But there aren't two sides to this:
[2017-01-06 10:49:54] <Maddox> 1. He talked behind my back and said he was using me for money. He's not an honest person
[2017-01-06 10:50:05] <Maddox> 2. He said women should expect to get raped. That's disgusting and victim-blaming
[2017-01-06 10:50:31] <wauterboi> You can say that he talked behind your back and is a shit friend, but you could also say he's trying to preserve the business relationship between you two.
[2017-01-06 10:50:35] <Maddox> 3. He hasn't shown me how much money we've made from sponsors. And he still won't. He has only released some bullshit spreadsheet and anyone can make one of those. He won't show me the statement
[2017-01-06 10:50:55] <wauterboi> And I think that if he really thought all the disgusting things about women he wouldn't have a girlfriend.
[2017-01-06 10:50:59] <Maddox> He's lying dude. The entire show was predicated upon our friendship. That's why the show ended after I saw that.
[2017-01-06 10:51:11] <Maddox> He has a girlfriend because my vindictive ex is fucking him to get back at me
[2017-01-06 10:51:14] <Maddox> She's obsessed with me
[2017-01-06 10:51:24] <wauterboi> Why not? Penn and Teller aren't friends. Their business parts.
[2017-01-06 10:51:34] <Maddox> Well that's not how I work
[2017-01-06 10:51:39] <Maddox> I don't work with anyone who's not my friend on some level
[2017-01-06 10:52:01] <Maddox> And our show was based largely on our stories and hanging out together. The undercooked rice, bro downs, hanging out at bars and parties... we were friends
[2017-01-06 10:52:04] <Maddox> He ruined our friendship
[2017-01-06 10:52:15] <Maddox> And he's trying to spin it like I'm obsessed with my ex. That's fucking disgusting dude.
[2017-01-06 10:52:30] <Maddox> Want to know why I haven't talked about my ex and why that shit upset me so much?
[2017-01-06 10:52:36] <Maddox> Because my ex was physically and verbally abusive
[2017-01-06 10:52:40] <Maddox> She threatened to burn my house down
[2017-01-06 10:52:56] <Maddox> So if he brought her back into my life in that capacity, I'd file a restraining order against her and she'd lose her job because she's a teacher
[2017-01-06 10:53:02] <Maddox> These are two vindictive people who are trying to fuck with me
[2017-01-06 10:53:11] <Maddox> My ex got extremely jealous when I started dating Jessica
[2017-01-06 10:53:29] <Maddox> Do you know how disrespectful it is to suggest that I have any interest in that awful person anymore? How do you think that makes Jessica feel?
[2017-01-06 10:53:53] <wauterboi> Probably awful. Did you intend for her and Jessica to be friends ever?
[2017-01-06 10:54:26] <Maddox> They were friendly, but it doesn't matter what I intend, I don't control people. I just wanted them to be okay with each other. Jessica was fine with it. They had hung out once before.
[2017-01-06 10:54:30] <Maddox> My ex lost her mind
[2017-01-06 10:54:34] <Maddox> And started stalking me
[2017-01-06 10:54:37] <Maddox> And the girls I dated
[2017-01-06 10:54:46] <Maddox> And threatened to cut down my Christmas lights
[2017-01-06 10:55:08] <Maddox> I still have a broken door in my apartment from her abuse that she hasn't paid for. So I'm telling you dude, if I go public with this, she loses her job because she's a teacher
[2017-01-06 10:55:22] <Maddox> Why do you ask?
[2017-01-06 10:56:39] <wauterboi> Do you by any chance get the bonus episodes
[2017-01-06 10:56:54] <Maddox> No dude
[2017-01-06 10:56:59] <Maddox> I don't listen to any of his slander
[2017-01-06 10:57:02] <Maddox> I don't know what's been said
[2017-01-06 10:57:29] <wauterboi> I don't know if you want to but I can send you the last episode talks about you and Eighties girl
[2017-01-06 10:57:35] <Maddox> Fuck no.
[2017-01-06 10:57:39] <Maddox> I'm not listening to that bullshit
[2017-01-06 10:57:44] <Maddox> It's all lies
[2017-01-06 10:57:52] <Maddox> Everything he says is either a lie or misleading
[2017-01-06 10:58:31] <Maddox> What do I need to know?
[2017-01-06 10:59:29] <wauterboi> [reuploaded image: http://www.wauterboi.com/peen/003_eggs.jpg] I am going to attempt flipping all of these eggs and then give you the run down .
[2017-01-06 11:00:03] <Maddox> hehe good luck
[2017-01-06 11:03:42] <Maddox> One thing you said though dude, "And I think that if he really thought all the disgusting things about women he wouldn't have a girlfriend." -- you know women are in abusive relationships all the time. Sometimes they put up with it for various reasons. So that's not true. My ex was abusive to me and I put up with it for too long
[2017-01-06 11:06:23] <wauterboi> Yeah, I'll accept that
[2017-01-06 11:11:13] <wauterboi> So, I can clip out his story for you and send it to you because that's gonna be a whole lot easier. But he basically explained the entirety of his side of the wedding story.
[2017-01-06 11:11:19] <wauterboi> In full detail.
[2017-01-06 11:11:38] <wauterboi> Well, whatever his version of full detail is.
[2017-01-06 11:12:28] <Maddox> Probably none of it is true
[2017-01-06 11:12:41] <Maddox> I'm not going to listen to it dude, sorry I don't have time
[2017-01-06 11:13:03] <Maddox> I'll tell you what happened (the truth): My ex was there, she texted me a whole bunch before the wedding making sure it was okay to come, I told her it was fine but I was bringing my date
[2017-01-06 11:13:14] <Maddox> Jessica and I were still newly dating
[2017-01-06 11:13:38] <Maddox> My ex got really jealous because before the wedding she sent me an email asking to get back together, and said she was always going to be in love with me, even with new guys she dated
[2017-01-06 11:13:47] <Maddox> I told her it was too late and I'd moved on, but that we could still be friends
[2017-01-06 11:14:03] <Maddox> Then before the wedding she invited me to go to Mexico with her, I turned her down again and it pissed her off
[2017-01-06 11:14:22] <Maddox> Then at the wedding, Jessica caught the bouqet and my ex lost her mind, she got pissed
[2017-01-06 11:14:30] <Maddox> And then Jessica started talking about wedding venues
[2017-01-06 11:15:00] <Maddox> And my ex came up to me in private and said "where do you want to get married?" And then before I had a chance to answer, she walked away from me and started flirting with Dax
[2017-01-06 11:15:25] <Maddox> They left the wedding together which made me furious because she has a DUI and Dax was drunk, he could have gotten her killed and she could have lost her job
[2017-01-06 11:15:31] <Maddox> I bet he didn't tell you guys that part
[2017-01-06 11:15:44] <Maddox> But yeah, that's pretty much it. And she called me a few days later and apologized for it
[2017-01-06 11:16:06] <Maddox> Dax called me and said "if you want to kick me off the show for a while I understand" and I took him up on his offer, which is why he missed Episode 77
[2017-01-06 11:16:15] <Maddox> It wasn't because I asked him not to come. He offered and I took him up on his offer
[2017-01-06 11:19:29] <wauterboi> He did tell us
[2017-01-06 11:19:53] <Maddox> He told all of that?
[2017-01-06 11:20:03] <wauterboi> And boy is his version of the story a lot different. Contains some of those same elements
[2017-01-06 11:20:09] <Maddox> Because he made it sound like he was kicked off episode 77. He offered and I accepted.
[2017-01-06 11:20:22] <Maddox> Well I'm sure it's a lot different because he's a liar
[2017-01-06 11:20:32] <Maddox> But why would you trust someone who talks behind his friend's back?
[2017-01-06 11:20:38] <Maddox> Even if I'm a total asshole
[2017-01-06 11:20:49] <Maddox> And even if half the stuff he said about me is true (none of it is true)
[2017-01-06 11:21:26] <Maddox> He has made so much money off me and he has used me so much. Everything good in his life right now except for his day job came from me: his girlfriend, Asterios, Randy, his popularity, everything. Is that a way to treat anyone? To slander them and go after their livelihoods?
[2017-01-06 11:21:29] <wauterboi> Well, when is talking behind someone's back acceptable or not acceptable? I vent a lot to people. But I'm also not ashamed or that.
[2017-01-06 11:21:37] <Maddox> Dude
[2017-01-06 11:21:39] <Maddox> C'mon man.
[2017-01-06 11:21:47] <Maddox> He said he was USING ME for money and publicity
[2017-01-06 11:21:51] <Maddox> That's why I haven't talked about this
[2017-01-06 11:22:04] <Maddox> He's pulling a Donald Trump. He's trying to get me to refute his lies so he gets more publicity
[2017-01-06 11:22:05] <Maddox> That's all it is
[2017-01-06 11:22:15] <Maddox> You think he's a good person on any level?
[2017-01-06 11:22:21] <Maddox> After all the heinous shit he's said about me?
[2017-01-06 11:22:34] <Maddox> He said he slept with wives
[2017-01-06 11:22:39] <Maddox> You know who he slept with? His friend's wife
[2017-01-06 11:23:14] <Maddox> Dude, nothing he says is true. If you want to know the truth about anything, just ask
[2017-01-06 11:25:01] <wauterboi> I am curious about something, though. How tolerant of you of people who support Trump?
[2017-01-06 11:25:51] <wauterboi> I hated both candidates. I was big on Bernie, so don't get any ideas. :P
[2017-01-06 11:26:05] <Maddox> Eh, I don't care that much really personally. If they have a good reason to be Trump supporters, whatever. I think Trump is disgusting, but some of my friends support him for legitimate reasons. The ones who don't denounce him for saying and doing racist shit are the ones I have a problem with
[2017-01-06 11:26:19] <Maddox> I didn't care that much that Dax was a Trump supporter. I thought he was an idiot for doing it, but whatever.
[2017-01-06 11:26:49] <Maddox> Lemme ask you something: Do you feel that I included his rape comments in that video out of spite?
[2017-01-06 11:27:33] <wauterboi> I dunno. I believe I sent you a message first thing saying I completely disagreed with that aspect of the video. I don't know if spite is the right word.
[2017-01-06 11:27:51] <Maddox> We were driving up to Valencia a long time ago and we got in a heated argument where he told me the same thing, only worse: if a girl passes out drunk, not only should she expect to get raped, but it's her fault
[2017-01-06 11:27:59] <Maddox> I had a huge problem with that, and told him to shut the fuck up
[2017-01-06 11:28:19] <Maddox> I even brought this up in time-stamped notes I made for a meeting on The Biggest Problem. So there's evidence that I've always had a problem of this
[2017-01-06 11:30:04] <wauterboi> To be fair, I do believe that women have a responsibility to maintain their own safety because there are awful, awful people out there.
[2017-01-06 11:30:40] <wauterboi> So, in some way, it is their responsibility.
[2017-01-06 11:30:59] <wauterboi> When I go on my walks, I expect to be mugged so I don't get mugged.
[2017-01-06 11:31:02] <Maddox> Well duh, of course they do. It's one thing to say that women should take precautions. We all should. That's not what he was saying
[2017-01-06 11:31:13] <Maddox> He said they should EXPECT to get raped. Nobody expects to get raped because then it's their fault
[2017-01-06 11:32:11] <wauterboi> I'm not following. How do expectations translate to blame?
[2017-01-06 11:32:22] <Maddox> If you expect to get raped, then it's your fault.
[2017-01-06 11:32:41] <wauterboi> I expect the whole world to fuck with me at every turn. That doesn't mean I think it's my fault.
[2017-01-06 11:32:55] <Maddox> No, you can take precautions
[2017-01-06 11:33:05] <Maddox> But you don't expect it.
[2017-01-06 11:33:29] <Maddox> When you get raped nobody says "it's okay, I was expecting it."
[2017-01-06 11:33:54] <wauterboi> You don't expect there to be sharks trying to fuck you over in show business for the sheer fact that it's the name of the game for show business?
[2017-01-06 11:34:00] <Maddox> A girl can pass out drunk, spread eagle and with her panties off and vagina open but she still shouldn't expect to get raped. Nobody expects it or invites rape. Rape is not a thing you plan for.
[2017-01-06 11:34:03] <wauterboi> Or people to lie to you, let you down, etc?
[2017-01-06 11:34:28] <Maddox> It might be stupid to pass out drunk spread eagle, but to say you expected it means you're victim-blaming
[2017-01-06 11:35:04] <wauterboi> Well, if I saw a girl passed out drunk I wouldn't even be thinking in terms of blaming but instead picking her up and making sure she's okay.
[2017-01-06 11:35:16] <wauterboi> I don't think in terms of blaming very often. It's not useful.
[2017-01-06 11:35:27] <wauterboi> *not always
[2017-01-06 11:35:41] <Maddox> You know what the cops asked my friend who got raped?
[2017-01-06 11:35:44] <Maddox> "How drunk were you?"
[2017-01-06 11:35:52] <Maddox> Doesn't matter. She was raped.
[2017-01-06 11:35:59] <Maddox> That's why this shit is important
[2017-01-06 11:36:19] <Maddox> and again, I'm not a feminist or an SJW, but since when does it make someone an SJW to be against rape?
[2017-01-06 11:36:41] <wauterboi> That's a different topic entirely, one that I wanted to bring into TBPITU. :P
[2017-01-06 11:37:11] <Maddox> What he said on his site isn't satire
[2017-01-06 11:37:26] <Maddox> Satire has to be making a point. What's the point he's making by telling women to just "take a warm shower" if they get raped?
[2017-01-06 11:37:41] <Maddox> What's the point he's making by telling guys that if you fuck a passed out girl, you're not a rapist?
[2017-01-06 11:37:41] <wauterboi> I thought it was making a point about statistics.
[2017-01-06 11:37:55] <wauterboi> "Look at how much I can manipulate stats to make a false truth."
[2017-01-06 11:38:00] <Maddox> What does saying a guy who rapes a passed out girl isn't a rapist have to do with that point about statistics?
[2017-01-06 11:38:13] <Maddox> You can't just write anything and have it be a satire
[2017-01-06 11:38:19] <wauterboi> It's making a joke using an obvious lie to make a point.
[2017-01-06 11:38:24] <Maddox> That's a joke?
[2017-01-06 11:38:33] <wauterboi> I didn't say I like the joke.
[2017-01-06 11:38:55] <Maddox> "Hey if you fuck a drunk girl who's passed out, you're not a rapist!" ��
[2017-01-06 11:39:07] <Maddox> get it? You're not a rapist
[2017-01-06 11:39:18] <Maddox> And she should get over it with a warm shower! LOL
[2017-01-06 11:39:26] <wauterboi> Oh, I'm not talking about that specifically. That is a shit joke.
[2017-01-06 11:39:36] <Maddox> Why are you giving him the benefit of doubt?
[2017-01-06 11:39:38] <wauterboi> But the article in its entirety I think is about statistics.
[2017-01-06 11:39:54] <wauterboi> Because I don't think much about the article in the first place. It isn't interesting to me.
[2017-01-06 11:40:29] <wauterboi> And much like you want me to give Jesse the benefit of the doubt for a joke instead of being racist for saying nigger. I'm not interested enough to hate the guy or feel anything either way.
[2017-01-06 11:41:01] <Maddox> Well Jesse has a black co-host
[2017-01-06 11:41:17] <Maddox> And had 4 black guests on his show for Christmas
[2017-01-06 11:41:19] <wauterboi> And Dick has a girlfriend.
[2017-01-06 11:41:34] <Maddox> Dax has a vindictive ex who's trying to get back at me
[2017-01-06 11:42:51] <Maddox> You know what I think? I think you're experiencing cognitive dissonance. You're a good guy with a good heart and a good head on his shoulders. You see all this shit: he expects women to get raped, he said guys who fuck passed out girls aren't rapists, women should take a warm shower and get over rape, his fans made a rape list, his fans made rape threats against Jessica, he told Ela Darling to get AIDS, Asterios' ex-wife got death threats. his guest Lenore got rape threats, and now they're attacking my livelihood and all of that stuff makes you feel uncomfortable
[2017-01-06 11:42:56] <Maddox> I don't blame you
[2017-01-06 11:43:26] <Maddox> Stand up for your values
[2017-01-06 11:43:27] <wauterboi> Oh, it does make me uncomfortable. I'd like stuff to move on. Same for my little brother.
[2017-01-06 11:44:17] <wauterboi> But I'm not going to attack Dick because this is a foundation of hearsay. Valuable hearsay, but still hearsay. And that makes for a bigger violation of my principles.
[2017-01-06 11:44:48] <Maddox> Well you support him
[2017-01-06 11:44:51] <Maddox> And he's hurting me
[2017-01-06 11:44:55] <Maddox> And Jessica
[2017-01-06 11:44:57] <Maddox> And Ela
[2017-01-06 11:45:00] <Maddox> And lots of people in real life
[2017-01-06 11:47:22] <wauterboi> That reminds me that Ela blocked me I think with an autoblocker.
[2017-01-06 11:48:03] <Maddox> Yes, because Dax had all his fans harassing her
[2017-01-06 11:48:06] <Maddox> And Jessica
[2017-01-06 11:48:14] <Maddox> But yeah, the fans are good people and not creepy assholes
[2017-01-06 11:48:15] <Maddox> Right?
[2017-01-06 11:49:24] <wauterboi> I'm sure some of them are.
[2017-01-06 11:49:45] <wauterboi> But if I can survive in there there's moderates.
[2017-01-06 11:50:05] <wauterboi> I can tell you straight up that the Facebook group is concentrated cancer from hell.
[2017-01-06 11:50:15] <wauterboi> The reddit is a lot better. The IRC moreso.
[2017-01-06 11:50:32] <wauterboi> The Facebook is basically shit 4chan.
[2017-01-06 11:51:05] <wauterboi> They also thought I was "compromised" for talking to you. So if you and I are aiming for some sort of concensus, fuck the Facebook group.
[2017-01-06 11:51:53] <wauterboi> But it's kind of the same thing as Trump supporters. I have a lot of Trump supporting friends. They're not all racist assholes. They aren't all bigots. Some of them even dislike the rhetoric Trump uses. Same thing with Dick.
[2017-01-06 11:52:09] <wauterboi> There's a lot of people who don't like the "hot goss".
[2017-01-06 11:52:33] <Maddox> You're trying really hard to justify this cognitive dissonance. They're attacking me dude
[2017-01-06 11:52:38] <Maddox> They're attacking our livelihood
[2017-01-06 11:52:41] <Maddox> The way I make a living
[2017-01-06 11:53:06] <Maddox> Just because there are some good apples in there doesn't mean they're good people. Good people don't harass stalk and abuse others
[2017-01-06 11:53:18] <wauterboi> Who is "they"?
[2017-01-06 11:54:18] <wauterboi> There's a lot of people in the channel that haven't ever tweeted at ya.
[2017-01-06 11:54:26] <wauterboi> Or done anything with you.
[2017-01-06 11:55:08] <wauterboi> There's a lot of distaste for you but you'd be hard pressed to find anything more than people tweeting about you or talking about you in relative privacy
[2017-01-06 11:58:25] <Maddox> Dude, there are a lot of bad eggs in that community
[2017-01-06 11:58:29] <Maddox> actual white supremacists
[2017-01-06 11:58:37] <Maddox> Dax had a problem when I kicked them out from the old show
[2017-01-06 11:58:41] <Maddox> He tolerates them there
[2017-01-06 11:58:49] <Maddox> His fans dox and harass people
[2017-01-06 11:59:00] <Maddox> and make rape threats. The whole fan base is toxic
[2017-01-06 11:59:07] <Maddox> I know that's not you
[2017-01-06 11:59:13] <Maddox> And I know you're a good guy and there are a few good eggs in there
[2017-01-06 11:59:22] <Maddox> But look at the way they gang up on me and pile on with lies and bullshit and harassment
[2017-01-06 11:59:25] <Maddox> These aren't good people.
[2017-01-06 11:59:44] <wauterboi> There's an actual racist in our chatroom, but the funny thing is he's good friends with me, a Mexican, and Denzel. :P

[Note] That guy that I'm talking about is someone who hung out in the IRC for a long time, and I have done comissioned work for. I also argued with him a lot. Who cares? You move on. There's other people in the chatroom I talked to that weren't racist. Get over it. The point I was trying to make is sure there's racists in Dick's camp. But there's probably racists following Maddox, or playing Call of Duty, or voting. That doesn't make the entire entity they're participating in racist - that's stupid. And Denzel was able to function without sperging out, so I don't see what the big deal is.

[2017-01-06 12:00:10] <Maddox> But you have a problem with Jesse saying "nigger... just kidding" and then apologizing directly to Denzel?
[2017-01-06 12:00:31] <wauterboi> Nah. I was thinking it would hurt your brand.
[2017-01-06 12:00:48] <Maddox> That show wasn't on my network
[2017-01-06 12:00:54] <Maddox> It has nothing to do with Madcast Media
[2017-01-06 12:00:57] <Maddox> You know he does 3 shows right?
[2017-01-06 12:01:01] <Maddox> And only one of them is on my network
[2017-01-06 12:01:03] <Maddox> They're slandering me
[2017-01-06 12:01:04] <wauterboi> Oh.
[2017-01-06 12:02:06] <wauterboi> Are you on good terms with Denzel?
[2017-01-06 12:02:09] <Maddox> Yes
[2017-01-06 12:02:48] <wauterboi> So that makes me and Denzel in the IRC.
[2017-01-06 12:02:59] <wauterboi> He's in there quite a bit.
[2017-01-06 12:03:08] <wauterboi> And he gets along with said racist.
[2017-01-06 12:03:26] <wauterboi> They actually get into debates, as do I.
[2017-01-06 12:03:48] <Maddox> Cool, glad you spend your time talking to racists :)
[2017-01-06 12:03:48] <wauterboi> The only way to kill bad ideas is actually argue them instead of dismissing them outright. Challenging them and yourself.
[2017-01-06 12:03:55] <Maddox> Dude
[2017-01-06 12:03:59] <Maddox> I love you man
[2017-01-06 12:04:07] <Maddox> But you need to understand something: Dax is doing this for publicity
[2017-01-06 12:04:13] <Maddox> Every time there's drama, his patreon bucks go up
[2017-01-06 12:04:15] <Maddox> You're being played
[2017-01-06 12:04:19] <Maddox> That's why I'm staying silent
[2017-01-06 12:04:27] <Maddox> He's got nothing without me. Nobody knows who he is or cares
[2017-01-06 12:04:30] <Maddox> His numbers are fake too
[2017-01-06 12:04:33] <Maddox> Look:
[2017-01-06 12:04:44] <Maddox> [this is just a screenshot of chrome freaking out saying that thedickshow.com has malware]
[2017-01-06 12:04:54] <Maddox> He changed servers because his got hacked
[2017-01-06 12:05:00] <Maddox> Then he sent out all his episodes again
[2017-01-06 12:05:10] <Maddox> No podcast gets 200,000 downloads in a month without being in iTunes top 10
[2017-01-06 12:05:16] <Maddox> He hasn't even crossed iTunes top 200
[2017-01-06 12:06:02] <wauterboi> Whether or not I'm being "played" doesn't bother me because I like his energy. That's really it. It doesn't really have to do with community or Goss.
[2017-01-06 12:06:30] <Maddox> Cool, well it comes at the expense of hurting real life people
[2017-01-06 12:06:34] <Maddox> Like Jessica and myself
[2017-01-06 12:06:34] <wauterboi> I'm not clutching my phone with the shakes for more hot goss. I just like hearing him complain about inane things like on the old show.
[2017-01-06 12:06:53] <Maddox> [he sent this unironically http://www.wauterboi.com/peen/003_quote.png]
[2017-01-06 12:07:41] <wauterboi> So the answer is to stop consuming his content?
[2017-01-06 12:08:05] <wauterboi> Exit the community, stop talking to dickheads, move on?
[2017-01-06 12:08:09] <Maddox> No
[2017-01-06 12:08:15] <Maddox> I'm not asking you to do that, I'm not asking anyone to
[2017-01-06 12:08:27] <Maddox> Listen to what you want, but please don't delude yourself into thinking these aren't bad people
[2017-01-06 12:08:36] <Maddox> If you're a good person, speak out when you see abuse
[2017-01-06 12:09:04] <Maddox> Speak out when they're sicking the job lynch mob after me. I haven't gone after Dax's livelihood. This is where he works: http://foundationdigital.com/dax-herrera/
[2017-01-06 12:09:13] <wauterboi> I've seen that.
[2017-01-06 12:09:14] <Maddox> I haven't gone after his patreon, don't care about any of that
[2017-01-06 12:09:19] <Maddox> His fans have gone after me and my livelhood
[2017-01-06 12:09:32] <Maddox> If you see fans threatening to harass us, you can speak out. It's your call
[2017-01-06 12:09:41] <Maddox> But just know: you're part of a group that are hurting real-world people
[2017-01-06 12:10:38] <wauterboi> At what point does that really matter, though? Does being an American make one responsible for America's actions?
[2017-01-06 12:10:54] <Maddox> Again, you're rationalizing it
[2017-01-06 12:10:58] <Maddox> Stop dude.
[2017-01-06 12:11:04] <wauterboi> I tell dickheads that they're being fuckfaces when they suggest fucky things.
[2017-01-06 12:11:10] <Maddox> You're part of that community.
[2017-01-06 12:11:11] <wauterboi> But that's on an individual basis.
[2017-01-06 12:11:18] <Maddox> Why are you hanging out with people who suggest fucky things?
[2017-01-06 12:11:27] <wauterboi> Not all of them do.
[2017-01-06 12:11:34] <Maddox> The majority of them do
[2017-01-06 12:11:42] <Maddox> Look at how much we've been harassed
[2017-01-06 12:11:47] <Maddox> Look at the number of posts in there about me
[2017-01-06 12:11:50] <Maddox> Look at how much they slander me
[2017-01-06 12:11:53] <Maddox> Those are not good people
[2017-01-06 12:12:14] <Maddox> I'm sure not all KKK members would actually kill black people, or harass someone in real life, etc. But they're generally bad people.
[2017-01-06 12:13:05] <Maddox> That whole community is filled with negativity and slander
[2017-01-06 12:13:15] <Maddox> The signs are everywhere if you don't ignore them
[2017-01-06 12:14:11] <wauterboi> I don't ignore anything.
[2017-01-06 12:14:17] <Maddox> Rape threats, death threats, Asterios' ex-wife being threatened, Jessica getting doxxed, Ela being attacked, Erin Tillman being put on a rape list, rape threats made against Lenore, Kendal and Hyde getting harassed, Cameron getting Doxxed, etc. Enough is enough dude. You can bury your head in the sand all you want, but at least acknowledge the fan base is largely toxic.
[2017-01-06 12:14:39] <Maddox> And now they're coming after my sponsors even though I haven't done anything. These are good people. Right.
[2017-01-06 12:15:13] <wauterboi> Sounds like the people in the Facebook, which I avoid.
[2017-01-06 12:15:28] <wauterboi> Which dick isn't even in.
[2017-01-06 12:15:55] <wauterboi> And Kendal and Hyde getting harassed sounds like it's because they aren't a very good business.
[2017-01-06 12:16:13] <Maddox> No dude
[2017-01-06 12:16:21] <Maddox> They're great, they got harassed by Dax first
[2017-01-06 12:16:28] <Maddox> That's part of the reason I released my video
[2017-01-06 12:16:39] <Maddox> You guys are hurting a small business
[2017-01-06 12:16:46] <Maddox> And Dax attacked my developer, JOQ
[2017-01-06 12:16:49] <Maddox> Enough is enough
[2017-01-06 12:16:58] <Maddox> You're rationalizing it, but you know it's wrong
[2017-01-06 12:17:10] <wauterboi> https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/4z43nq/dont_buy_from_kendal_hyde_unless_you_are/
[2017-01-06 12:17:13] <Maddox> What if I started directing my fans to start attacking him and Asterios and you and everyone's livelihood?
[2017-01-06 12:17:54] <wauterboi> I'd release all the conversations we had, tell you to fuck off, and call it a day. :P
[2017-01-06 12:18:18] <Maddox> haha well that's not what I'm suggesting of course, I'm just asking you how you'd feel if people did that to you?
[2017-01-06 12:18:47] <Maddox> Yeah the owner of the company got in there to sort things out and make it right. Bad companies don't care about their customers. They care a lot. They had a supply problem with one of their items and sorted it out
[2017-01-06 12:18:53] <wauterboi> Shitty, but people are shit. People already stalk me, and fuck with me, and dox me.
[2017-01-06 12:19:11] <wauterboi> The world is shit.
[2017-01-06 12:19:40] <wauterboi> Not that I think you guys deserve it and that it's acceptable.
[2017-01-06 12:19:55] <Maddox> Right, it is shitty
[2017-01-06 12:20:09] <Maddox> Remember dude... all it takes for evil to triumph is for good people to stand by and do nothing
[2017-01-06 12:20:23] <Maddox> When you see people doing bad things, speak out
[2017-01-06 12:20:43] <wauterboi> [This was a link to a .jpg off my other defunct website and I'm pretty sure it was just an innocuous image of the IRC talking about Amazon packaging. I asked when was the last time people contacted Maddox for anything.]
[2017-01-06 12:20:45] <Maddox> I'm telling you as someone who knew Dax for 10 years, he's become a truly bad person. He's done so much more that I haven't said to anyone.
[2017-01-06 12:21:13] <wauterboi> This is what the chat looks like right now. There isn't a lot going on right now. It's a lot of off-topic banter. And it's usually like that.
[2017-01-06 12:21:22] <wauterboi> It isn't a coven to conspire against you.
[2017-01-06 12:22:19] <wauterboi> Hell, you could join our chat, sit silently, and see what we do.
[2017-01-06 12:22:22] <wauterboi> It's a bunch of dumb nerd shit.
[2017-01-06 12:22:26] <Maddox> Thanks
[2017-01-06 12:22:31] <Maddox> well look buddy I have to go soon
[2017-01-06 12:22:48] <Maddox> Almost everything said about me has been a lie, and I'm happy to clear it up
[2017-01-06 12:22:54] <wauterboi> Gotcha man. Take it easy, and I'm still here if you wanna chat.
[2017-01-06 12:23:19] <Maddox> And you see when you asked that question, nobody answered. I talked to maybe a handful of people who asked and I made them all promise not to share the conversations. Not because I'm afraid of anything, I just don't want to fuel the goss and let him slander me more
[2017-01-06 12:24:27] <wauterboi> Nobody answered because not everyone in the chat is always active and people aren't quick to chat about you. Right now people are talking about amazon sellers packing cables in envelopes. And someone just said "No contact aside from Twitter yesterday."
[2017-01-06 12:28:29] <Maddox> Also nobody answered because I'm telling the truth
[2017-01-06 12:29:22] <Maddox> If I wanted this stuff to be pubic, I'd make it public. I'm not interested in giving Dax more content for his show because he's creatively bankrupt and has nothing else to talk about. That's why he talks about his crotch and blue humor so much. Everything is dicks / blow jobs / scat. That's all he's got. Pay attention to the number of times he talks about that kind of stuff
[2017-01-06 12:29:42] <Maddox> Anyway buddy, I'm out. Thanks for chatting, you're a good guy. Stand up for your principles and speak up if you see people doing something bad.
[2017-01-06 12:29:51] <Maddox> Myself included, if you think I'm doing something wrong. Thanks
[2017-01-06 12:30:19] <wauterboi> See ya, man.
[2017-01-06 14:31:52] <Maddox> If you're curious, here's what Jesse has said:
[2017-01-06 14:31:54] <Maddox> I was trying to make the guy I was on skype with uncomfortable by saying it as a joke, and it fell flat. That's why I've apologized to Denzel over it. It wasn't even directed AT Denzel, it was to make the other guy uncomfortable. That context is a bit removed without the video where you can see him cringe, but either way it fell flat.
[2017-01-06 14:32:06] <Maddox> I listened back to the clip, and I could see that in that context, it was a poor joke and didn't work at all. I agree I can and should do better (although nobody here is saying I can.) So while I don't apologize for saying the word (because that is ridiculous, and let's be honest, no one here actually cares about that part, that is just posturing) I do apologize for targeting a dude I don't know with a joke so lazy that it just sounds actually racist. In the middle of a 2 and a half hour show I had one big flop. Admittedly, sometimes when you talk for hours, you just say anything to fill the time.
[2017-01-06 14:32:45] <wauterboi> gotcha, that's what I figured.
[2017-01-06 14:33:27] <wauterboi> He seems like one to try and be edgy.
[2017-01-06 14:34:26] <Maddox> He apologized directly to Denzel too
[2017-01-06 14:35:06] <wauterboi> That I also saw. I'm not very concerned about him because I don't really like him. I just saw that it caused a spark and I was wondering how you were going about it
[2017-01-06 14:35:13] <Maddox> But I'm sure the idiotic dick warts will keep posturing and pretending like they give a shit about this to damage me because Dax keeps inciting them. This episode wasn't even on Madcast Media. It's one of Jesse's 2 other shows that he doesn't publish on my network
[2017-01-06 14:37:18] <wauterboi> on the other hand I'm remixing Rucka Rucka Ali right now :P
[2017-01-06 14:37:52] <wauterboi> he's cool
[2017-01-06 14:39:47] <wauterboi> Just for the sake of argument, do you understand why it bothered dick warts?
[2017-01-06 14:50:28] <Maddox> Well, dick warts I think are a disingenuous bunch. They're not fans of Jesse, they are just there looking for a gotcha. I don't believe anyone who supports Dax and all his bullying truly cares about the n-word taken out of context of a bad joke. That said, I don't support it and it has nothing to do with me or my network
[2017-01-06 14:51:00] <Maddox> I understand how it could bother you though because you're a decent person
[2017-01-06 14:53:42] <wauterboi> Well, they see it as you took out Dick for the accusation of rape apology and having awful fans, and yet you have Jesse who does a lot of raunchy things himself as well as Rucka Rucka Ali who does a lot of raunchy things himself. I don't think that people care so much about what Jesse actually did but see what's going on as inconsistency.
[2017-01-06 14:55:09] <wauterboi> Which, when paired together with what Dick has been saying it sounds like you took Dick out for banging your ex and you having Chump Syndrome. Not that I believe that, but that's what's out there.
[2017-01-06 14:56:53] <Maddox> Well I didn't know that he was until after the podcast ended. So there's that
[2017-01-06 14:57:07] <Maddox> Sean can verify. Dax is lying
[2017-01-06 14:57:33] <Maddox> I never called Dax a rape apologist. He and his fans did because he wants to martyr himself
[2017-01-06 14:58:10] <wauterboi> Honestly what needs to happen is I need to go KGB on the both of you, lock you two together in a dungeon with podcasting equipment, and record what happens because the disconnect between two sides is too much. :P
[2017-01-06 14:59:00] <Maddox> Buddy you have no idea what is going on here
[2017-01-06 14:59:25] <wauterboi> That's exactly what I just said. :P
[2017-01-06 14:59:34] <Maddox> We're dealing with an actual sociopath
[2017-01-06 14:59:44] <Maddox> Please stop
[2017-01-06 14:59:56] <Maddox> Seriously, don't fan these flames
[2017-01-06 15:00:05] <Maddox> Please keep this between us no matter what happens
[2017-01-06 15:00:39] <Maddox> But there are people who are seriously fearing for their lives. Dax is a sociopath. Even Asterios knows this. Please stop
[2017-01-06 15:00:53] <Maddox> Full stop
[2017-01-06 15:01:05] <Maddox> I'm not joking. This isn't "goss"
[2017-01-06 15:02:22] <wauterboi> Alright, I didn't mean that in a fucked up way. I'll stop
