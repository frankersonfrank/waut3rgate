[Preface] Maddox shares evidence of him and his girlfriend being doxxed, a screen-shot of the infamous "rape list", and an old email exchange with Lowtax. He expreses difficulty in apologizing to Dick for not mentioning him in the last episode. Also mentions Dick slept with his friend's ex to further cement his claim that Dick is a sociopath.

[2017-01-09 07:15:42] <wauterboi> I know I'm going to sound a bit fucked up for asking, but I recall Zoey Quinn and others talking about how they were getting harassed and threatened when they weren't, and the incentive for doing so was support both financially and socially.
[2017-01-09 07:16:41] <wauterboi> I'm not saying you two are liars of course, but people have in the past - are they real?
[2017-01-09 07:16:58] <wauterboi> I have no idea how to ask that without it seemingly an attack or something more than what I'm asking.
[2017-01-09 08:34:32] <Maddox> Dude. They put Jessica on the rape list
[2017-01-09 08:34:47] <Maddox> [http://www.wauterboi.com/peen/005-dox.jpg]
[2017-01-09 08:34:55] <Maddox> There she is being doxxed
[2017-01-09 08:34:59] <Maddox> [http://www.wauterboi.com/peen/005-rlist.jpg]
[2017-01-09 08:35:05] <Maddox> There she is on the rape list
[2017-01-09 08:35:14] <Maddox> [http://www.wauterboi.com/peen/005-dox2.jpg]
[2017-01-09 08:35:19] <Maddox> There are dick warts doxxing Cameron
[2017-01-09 08:35:32] <Maddox> REAL DOXXING, not Asterios' fake fucking ego bruise bullshit
[2017-01-09 08:35:42] <Maddox> [http://www.wauterboi.com/peen/005-dox3.jpg]
[2017-01-09 08:35:51] <Maddox> There they are harassing his girlfriend
[2017-01-09 08:37:21] <Maddox> Here they are trying to hack into Jessica's account shortly after they made the threat to on 8chan:
[2017-01-09 08:37:28] <Maddox> [http://www.wauterboi.com/peen/005-hack.jpg]
[2017-01-09 08:40:27] <Maddox> [http://www.wauterboi.com/peen/005-asterios.jpg]
[2017-01-09 08:40:38] <Maddox> There's Asterios' ex-wife getting threats
[2017-01-09 08:54:22] <Maddox> [http://www.wauterboi.com/peen/005-targeted_harassment.jpg]
[2017-01-09 08:54:32] <Maddox> Here's the type of targeted harassment I'm receiving from dick warts
[2017-01-09 08:55:08] <Maddox> This is only coming from one side: TDS. I'm not tweeting about, talking about or harassing Dax. This is what the dick warts are doing constantly, and what they've been doing even before the video was released.
[2017-01-09 08:55:29] <Maddox> Enough is enough. These idiots are going to get someone killed.
[2017-01-09 16:04:12] <wauterboi> So if the fear is death, perhaps the best solution is an apology.
[2017-01-09 16:04:39] <wauterboi> Simply apologize for trying to make out Dick to be an advocate of rape and trying to make out the board as a maintainer of a rape list.
[2017-01-09 16:04:59] <wauterboi> And apologize for not thanking Dick in the last episode.
[2017-01-09 16:06:26] <wauterboi> What people want is to know you have the capacity to change and realize that you have faults. They think they are attacking a character that is unable to do so and is willing to lie his way to being right. And whether or not you see it that way, I will say that in my experience with you you can be a bit immovable on certain things and you don't really talk about what you or Jess do to influence the situation.
[2017-01-09 16:07:49] <wauterboi> I will tell you straight up: the video was ineffective, and based on that video and the fact that I haven't seen Dick speak unquestionably ill of women in the way you describe, I'd say you're wrong for that. And I'd see what you posted as slander. The alternative is proving it, of course, so that it's not slander.
[2017-01-09 16:08:29] <wauterboi> Until you do so, a lot of Dickheads will see you as slanderous. And a small portion of them will go full-retard to fuck with you and Jess.
[2017-01-09 16:10:18] <wauterboi> I don't think you have to agree with everything the dickheads have said, because that's unreasonable. I don't agree with everything the dickheads say and hell, I treat Dick's stories as just that: stories. But I think you have played a helping hand in making yourself a target, and that truly kills me. I don't want you to be that.
[2017-01-09 16:10:47] <wauterboi> I don't think it's about blame. I don't think you are a bad person. I just think you have made mistakes.
[2017-01-09 16:27:07] <Maddox> Well the video I stand behind 100%. He expressed those sentiments to me in private in a much worse way, and he also told me and a guest that his mom thinks Dick is who he is and Dax is the character. It's not a joke or a ruse. And if anyone thinks I did that video just to hurt Dax, I stayed quiet for 4 months while he slandered me and when he finally attacked my sponsors, I had no choice but to release it. I even have time-stamped notes from a meeting with Randy where I brought up the rape comments to him. I warned him back when the show was still going not to say shit like that but he ignored me.
[2017-01-09 16:27:58] <Maddox> Maddox is a character. George is not. Whatever Maddox says on the air is obviously mostly bullshit, but I stand behind that video. The fans did create a rape list. They did harass my girlfriend and they did put Erin Tillman on the rape list. Enough is enough.
[2017-01-09 16:28:42] <Maddox> I didn't call Dax a rape apologist, you guys did. He used those words, not me. He wrote an article on his website saying a guy who fucks a drunk and passed out woman isn't a rapist. What am I missing here?
[2017-01-09 16:29:32] <Maddox> If you think this shit isn't serious, look at this comment on his rape article:
[2017-01-09 16:29:34] <Maddox> "I tried to kill myself because of rape and sexual harassment a little over a year ago. I don't understand why you think rape is funny. It kills people. To this day I still wish they would have just killed me. No, they had to let me live. My life is destroyed because of what those men did. I will never trust again or be happy. I want to die but I can't. I'm not strong enough to kill myself. I'm not strong enough to finish the job. They know I'm too weak to take my own life so that's why they made me live. I will be tortured for the rest of my life by them. The day God takes me home naturally, which I hope and pray he does soon, is the day I will be free."
[2017-01-09 16:30:22] <Maddox> I warned him 3 times before the podcast ended not to ever mention that rape shit to me and he still did. Then he had the audacity to complain about me editing shit out of the show. Fuck that. He said what he said and he doubled down.
[2017-01-09 16:30:56] <Maddox> The one thing I will apologize for is not mentioning him on the final episode. That was legitimately wrong. He has done far far far worse things to me and my reputation, and he owes me tons of apologies, but it wasn't my place to punish him like that.
[2017-01-09 16:31:53] <Maddox> But on the balance sheet, he has affected my livelihood, I haven't affected his (negatively anyway). He has harassed me for 8 months, I haven't harassed him. He has incited rape and death threats along with Asterios, I have done no such thing to him. He's a truly awful person. Just look at how often he slanders me... every fucking day.
[2017-01-09 16:33:19] <Maddox> I wish Dax and Asterios were more concerned about the women their awful fans are attacking than their shitty bruised egos. It's time they get over it and grow the fuck up before someone gets hurt or killed.
[2017-01-09 16:33:36] <Maddox> That fan base is toxic dude.
[2017-01-09 16:34:46] <Maddox> And if you want proof Dax attacked my sponsors, here you go, from August 27. I released my video 1 month later on September 26: https://twitter.com/dickmasterson/status/769450830630047745
[2017-01-09 16:34:50] <Maddox> Nice job lynch mob.
[2017-01-09 16:39:12] <Maddox> And you haven't seen him attack women?
[2017-01-09 16:39:30] <Maddox> [http://www.wauterboi.com/peen/005-women.jpg]
[2017-01-09 16:39:39] <Maddox> [http://www.wauterboi.com/peen/005-women2.jpg]
[2017-01-09 16:40:32] <Maddox> [http://www.wauterboi.com/peen/005-women3.jpg]
[2017-01-09 16:40:42] <Maddox> Yeah seems like a great guy.
[2017-01-09 16:41:01] <Maddox> Don't get played dude. This is the guy you're defending as being decent?
[2017-01-09 16:43:25] <Maddox> Asterios needs to publicly state that people need to stop sending rape and death threats to Jessica and that she did not dox him. He incited these attacks. I agree that Jessica shouldn't have posted that comment. I talked with her about it, but to accuse her of a crime she didn't commit and inciting a mob against her is disgusting. The worst that happened to Asterios is that he got exposed for being 2-faced. He didn't have to sob himself to sleep because people were threatening to rape him and calling his work to harass him
[2017-01-09 16:57:34] <Maddox> All of this started because of Dick. He talked behind my back like a fucking asshole, hid financial records from me and slandered me for 4 months. I have a right to defend myself and everything I released in that video is 100% true. He should spend less time worrying about his shitty reputation and more time worrying about his toxic fan base making rape lists. I've done this for 19 years and never had a rape list created by my fans. It's fucking disgusting. And I mean that with every ounce of my being. I don't think it makes me an SJW to be against rape.
[2017-01-09 16:59:46] <Maddox> Dax will never go back to UCB. He attacked them publicly and attacked all the women at UCB on his show. He's gone for life not because of that video, but because of what HE did and said.
[2017-01-09 17:00:04] <wauterboi> If you say he said it in private you have no actual defense.
[2017-01-09 17:00:22] <wauterboi> Not one that works for anyone but you. That's the honest truth.
[2017-01-09 17:00:43] <Maddox> Well he said it on air, so I don't know what I need to defend
[2017-01-09 17:00:46] <Maddox> He said it in writing too
[2017-01-09 17:00:51] <Maddox> So there you go
[2017-01-09 17:01:06] <Maddox> I don't want to have anything to do with him. I've moved on
[2017-01-09 17:01:40] <wauterboi> And there's problems with you saying what he said and what he wrote is the proof.
[2017-01-09 17:01:55] <Maddox> What am I trying to prove?
[2017-01-09 17:02:45] <Maddox> I don't stand for what he believes in. I don't care about any after-the-fact bullshit explanation he's saying to cover his ass.
[2017-01-09 17:04:53] <Maddox> Dax attacked Jessica on air before I released that video
[2017-01-09 17:04:56] <Maddox> He attacked me
[2017-01-09 17:04:58] <Maddox> He attacked my sponsors
[2017-01-09 17:05:00] <Maddox> Fuck him
[2017-01-09 17:08:20] <Maddox> I feel like you're going to try to rationalize anything I tell you because you've made up your mind based on his lies
[2017-01-09 17:08:28] <Maddox> Almost everything he has said about me is a lie.
[2017-01-09 17:12:36] <wauterboi> No, it's because you need to come up with a better defense. I'm coming from the point of view as the devil's advocate.
[2017-01-09 17:12:45] <wauterboi> I still care about you and that's exactly why I'm challenging you.
[2017-01-09 17:16:01] <Maddox> Thanks buddy
[2017-01-09 17:16:20] <Maddox> I appreciate that. I'm not sure what I need to defend myself against. I'm allowed to disagree with the point of view that women should expect to get raped
[2017-01-09 17:17:50] <wauterboi> The people that agree with Dick interpret what he said differently, meaning they think "expect" means "be prepared for", as I see it. In order to make Dick look the way you do you have to dismantle that defense.
[2017-01-09 17:17:55] <wauterboi> But how would you do it?
[2017-01-09 17:19:36] <wauterboi> https://strawpoll.de/8f67ec4
[2017-01-09 17:21:01] <wauterboi> This also kind of supports my hypothesis that most people don't want to hate you and probably aren't antagonizing you. You're being attacked by bottom of the barrel losers who probably fit in that 8.25% to ~22% of people, and I'd even guess that it's towards the tail end of that. There's a retarded vocal minority.
[2017-01-09 17:22:14] <Maddox> Maybe
[2017-01-09 17:22:21] <Maddox> But here's what I'm concerned with:
[2017-01-09 17:22:25] <Maddox> Dax is a sociopath (for real)
[2017-01-09 17:22:30] <Maddox> You know Lowtax?
[2017-01-09 17:22:38] <wauterboi> Yeah. He's a funny dude.
[2017-01-09 17:22:52] <Maddox> Cool... well did you know he and I feuded a while back? Back in 2002
[2017-01-09 17:23:00] <wauterboi> Did not know that.
[2017-01-09 17:23:09] <Maddox> I thought some of his writers were ripping me off. Turns out I was wrong, and I apologized
[2017-01-09 17:23:13] <Maddox> But he went on the attack
[2017-01-09 17:23:21] <Maddox> And got his whole forum to attack me
[2017-01-09 17:23:33] <Maddox> I apologized to him and made it clear on his forums that I apologized to him as well
[2017-01-09 17:23:40] <Maddox> But they still attacked me ruthlessly
[2017-01-09 17:23:50] <Maddox> So finally it died down
[2017-01-09 17:24:00] <Maddox> And years later when Hurricane Katrina happened, his servers got flooded
[2017-01-09 17:24:03] <Maddox> And this is the email I sent him:
[2017-01-09 17:24:16] <Maddox> [http://www.wauterboi.com/peen/005-lowtax.jpg]
[2017-01-09 17:24:56] <wauterboi> Damn.
[2017-01-09 17:25:00] <Maddox> That's the last time I talked with him. And today he's STILL attacking me. He's still calling me a faggot and saying he hates my guts
[2017-01-09 17:25:01] <Maddox> STILL
[2017-01-09 17:25:15] <Maddox> So what happens if I apologize and Dax takes it as a mandate for all the lies he said about me, and then continues the attack?
[2017-01-09 17:25:27] <wauterboi> He trolled Dick btw by kept saying that he was going to come on and then never coming on. :P
[2017-01-09 17:25:41] <wauterboi> I think it'll take a severe hit.
[2017-01-09 17:25:59] <wauterboi> I don't think Asterios is going to keep fueling the fire.
[2017-01-09 17:26:04] <Maddox> Who knows... but right now I haven't had an opportunity to apologize, and he has way more to apologize for.
[2017-01-09 17:26:27] <wauterboi> If asterios drops out, people will seriously move. The people that will be left are all of the regressive people anyway.,
[2017-01-09 17:26:35] <Maddox> He can start by what ended the podcast: talking behind my back and using me.
[2017-01-09 17:26:41] <Maddox> You know, I thought about what you said...
[2017-01-09 17:27:22] <Maddox> about how that email ended the podcast... but I think I disagree. I think actions can end things more than words. If you do something to get you fired, your boss ultimately fires you, but it's your actions that did it, you know?
[2017-01-09 17:27:41] <wauterboi> It depends.
[2017-01-09 17:27:58] <wauterboi> For me, I'm very focused on language. I become a huge asshole stickler over language.
[2017-01-09 17:28:16] <wauterboi> I obsessively re-read most of everything I write to the point of stress.
[2017-01-09 17:28:23] <wauterboi> And then even after I write it.
[2017-01-09 17:29:17] <wauterboi> On the other hand, my mom was recently called out for her body language. She was told that she was in the wrong for standing up when having a negative conversation with her boss - she considered that "standing over her". But it's still a problem of language.
[2017-01-09 17:30:27] <wauterboi> I think that if someone is effective with language, they have a lot of sway over the intensity of their actions in terms of how they affect relationships and what not. It's why politicians are people to be heavily, heavily criticized at every turn. It's why Trump is dangerous and also why I enjoy listening to him talk. It's super manipulative. It's like the most beautiful ugly thing ever.
[2017-01-09 17:30:32] <wauterboi> But that's a weird tangent.
[2017-01-09 17:30:58] <Maddox> heh
[2017-01-09 17:31:17] <Maddox> Well look man, I've known Dax for 10 years
[2017-01-09 17:31:19] <Maddox> or I thought I did
[2017-01-09 17:31:28] <Maddox> and I don't know him anymore. He's changed. He is all Dick and no Dax.
[2017-01-09 17:31:45] <Maddox> If I didn't believe that video's sentiments, I wouldn't have released it
[2017-01-09 17:32:12] <Maddox> I have a lot more to say about what a scumbag he is, but I refrained. That video was measured and reserved. He's said and done a lot of shitty things
[2017-01-09 17:32:16] <Maddox> He slept with his friend's wife dude.
[2017-01-09 17:32:21] <Maddox> His FRIEND
