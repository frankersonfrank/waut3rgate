[2017-01-06 12:17:13] <Maddox> What if I started directing my fans to start attacking him and Asterios and you and everyone's livelihood?  
[2017-01-06 12:17:54] <wauterboi> I'd release all the conversations we had, tell you to fuck off, and call it a day. :P

---------------
 What is this?
---------------

I was a fan of Maddox from the fifth grade in the mid 2000's to 2016. I submitted a lot of fan content to The Biggest Problem in the Universe - a podcast between him and Dick Masterson. With this connection, I began talking to Maddox between the start of 2016 and March of 2017. Most of these conversations took place on Twitter. This directory archives those Twitter conversations starting from the first conversation we had after the abrupt ending of The Biggest Problem in the Universe. It ends with him attempting to blackmail me into removing our leaked conversations from the internet so Dick and his friends don't lose their jobs. It's quite the escalation.

The reason I'm making these available come down to a few key bullet points:
1.) There is a clear demand for this content.
2.) Maddox spoke to me multiple times about how he has the power to make people lose their jobs but demanded that I never tell anyone about it.
3.) Maddox has successfully gotten Asterios to lose his job and attempted to stifle free speech in the United States of America. (see: https://medium.com/@asterios/i-got-james-gunnd-how-george-maddox-oz-got-me-fired-to-settle-a-score-c96e586c279f)
4.) Seeing as Maddox is now practicing the destruction of other people's lives, it has become worthwhile to learn about the kind of person Maddox really is.

 Why?
------

I did intend on keeping everything private, but I don't have infinte willpower. He wittled that down with the threat he posed to other people's lives and underhanded behavior he gave to Dick Masterson and Asterios Kokkinos. After I told him I wanted nothing to do with him anymore, I shared a few relatively innocuous examples of his insane mindset with The Dick Show IRC, which eventually made its way to Dick Masterson and blew up from there. Maddox learned of this and told me to get rid of the content (which was impossible at that point as people had already seen it and could potentially retrieve it or had already mirrored it) or that he would act on his plan, so I decided that I don't have the respect for him to keep anything private anymore, and leaked that too. After learning that his girlfriend tried to get Dick's girlfriend (Maddox's ex) fired from her teaching job by contacting all of the schools within her county, I leaked some more. And now that we are past a failed $360,000,000 malicious lawsuit that successfully killed the livelihood of Asterios, I just don't see any reason to hold back, except fear of retaliation which will undoubtedly produce a Streissand effect and make Maddox's public perception even worse.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Are you trustworthy? Can I trust I can talk to you without you leaking?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure. I think it's basic respect to not go around and sharing people's messages in public in an attempt to hurt their reputation. In this instance, I have made an exception, because I do not respect Maddox and he made the threats he did. So, in short, as long as you don't tell me you're going to destroy someone's life, I don't really have a reason to share anything.

-------------------
 Is this complete?
-------------------

This directory will continue to be updated. I have to work through about 6 months of conversations and format chat-logs, upload corresponding images, censor sensitive information, and explain where necessary.

--------------------------------
 What do you think of all this?
--------------------------------

Don't idolize celebrities - including e-celebrities. They're people. Hidden behind good art could very well be a deranged peson who desperately needs help. My hope is Maddox retires the "Maddox" name, repays for legal damages, and gets help. I'm not joking about getting help.

-------------------------------------------------
 Should I go troll Maddox? It'll be super funny.
-------------------------------------------------

I am against anything that validates Maddox being a martyr and actions that involve his personal life. Please don't make the community look bad by going after his friends or do anything stupid with his personal information. It's why I'm blurring stuff out in some of the reuploaded photos even if it is otherwise attainable - I'm not for that kind of behavior.

 I have a question/I would like to ruin your personal and professional reputation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All inquiries can be directed to my Twitter account - that is, unless you are Maddox (because I've blocked you for attempted blackmail) in which you will have to resort to Facebook or e-mails.
