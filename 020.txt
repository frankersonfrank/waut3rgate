[Preface] Nothing special

[2017-05-11 00:05:15] <wauterboi> [There was a website that used public information from multiple sources to basically "dox" everybody - where they lived, who their relatives were, their phone numbers, etc. I also sent it to Dick.]
[2017-05-11 00:05:32] <wauterboi> Hear me out: I'm linking you to this because this site is getting around and making news and I'm thinking you should request this info be taken down ASAP
[2017-05-11 00:06:02] <wauterboi> I'm on here. Dick is on here. Perhaps that info is outdated and perhaps it's not! But it may be in your interest to fight possible trolling that comes your way. :X
[2017-05-11 02:44:13] <Maddox> Thanks for the heads up
[2017-05-11 02:44:20] <Maddox> How did you find it?
[2017-05-11 09:32:51] <wauterboi> This is everyone's response, haha. I became aware of it because of a message board. Someone did a PSA saying that his website just rolled out. I just looked up your real name and used the process of elimination and if I can find it, that means someone who is far more dedicated and aggressive could find it.
[2017-05-11 09:33:05] <wauterboi> I was surprised at the level of accuracy with family members.
[2017-05-11 09:45:56] <Maddox> Thanks for telling me. The reason I ask is because I'm afraid the stalker/dickwarts might have found it...
[2017-05-11 09:46:56] <wauterboi> Nope. This was found out entirely by me. The first thing I did after looking for me and family was realize "oh shit" and contacted you, dick, and Asterios.
[2017-05-11 09:47:34] <wauterboi> I was able to find info on everyone and sent it to everyone to get taken down.
[2017-05-11 09:48:16] <Maddox> I wish you would have contacted me first, Dax and Asterios are stalking me
[2017-05-11 09:48:23] <Maddox> But I appreciate it nonetheless, good looking out
[2017-05-11 09:53:16] <Maddox> How are things?
[2017-05-11 09:57:25] <wauterboi> Mixture of feelings, really. Feeling unemployable is one thing. I really want to get out of this house.
[2017-05-11 09:57:55] <wauterboi> I'm hoping my transcribing interview works out on Friday.
[2017-05-11 11:38:47] <Maddox> What would you like to be doing?
[2017-05-11 11:39:48] <wauterboi> I'd like to be a media handyman and a programmer.
[2017-05-11 11:40:19] <wauterboi> People keep coming to me for theme songs and websites.
[2017-05-11 11:40:24] <wauterboi> But it ain't stable.
[2017-05-11 11:43:56] <wauterboi> Honesty I'd be happy with a stable job and time to fuck around on projects. Working retail was hell because it was very focused on hellish hours and no time to work on projects.
[2017-05-11 11:50:58] <Maddox> Have you looked at elance? https://www.elance.com/php/landing/main/login.php
[2017-05-11 11:56:09] <wauterboi> I have not! I'll have to check it out.
[2017-05-11 12:16:16] <Maddox> Yeah man, it'll probably take 4-7 years to build enough connections, but you can slowly grow your rolodex of freelance contacts who will refer you, if you do a good job, to other clients and get more and bigger gigs that way
[2017-05-11 12:16:33] <Maddox> or you might luck out and land a big gig right away
[2017-05-11 12:16:41] <Maddox> but it takes time and a portfolio with lots of experience
