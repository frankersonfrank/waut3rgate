[2017-05-14 22:07:10] <wauterboi> Are you using your nuclear option?
[2017-05-14 23:02:38] <wauterboi> It's 11 at night so I understand if you're not getting this very quick, but I'm hearing that you've called the cops on Dick over drugs.

[Note] I actually have no idea what came out of that rumor. I just heard it from the IRC.

[2017-05-14 23:04:06] <wauterboi> I know you aren't eager to talk about that, but I just feel like more and more things don't add up on your side of the story and the more things don't sound like defense.
[2017-05-14 23:15:34] <Maddox> No. Jesus, I haven't done anything. I'm tired of talking about this.
[2017-05-14 23:17:04] <Maddox> There is no "defense" or side of the story because I haven't told mine. I don't care about the dickwarts or any of Dax's bullshit lies. I haven't talked about him in public at all except for a 3 minute video. Time for everyone to move on. I don't have time for this drama. This is 100% him. He's completely obsessed with me. He needs serious psychotherapy. He tweets about me every fucking day. How do you not see who the problem child is? Seriously?
[2017-05-14 23:17:34] <Maddox> Also you said you'd stop supporting him after I showed you the quote of him saying a guy who fucks a passed out girl isn't a rapist... so what are you doing?
[2017-05-14 23:18:56] <wauterboi> I don't recall me saying that.
[2017-05-14 23:19:41] <wauterboi> Oh, I said if you could give hard evidence and then you linked to his book/site
[2017-05-14 23:21:02] <Maddox> [http://www.wauterboi.com/peen/021-earlier_chatlog.jpg]
[2017-05-14 23:22:44] <Maddox> He said that. I proved it to you. And you're still supporting him? There it is in your own words, you said you wouldn't support him if he said that. And he did.
[2017-05-14 23:25:21] <Maddox> Dick lies about everything. He lied about why the show ended. He lied about the finances. He lied directly to YOU in an email. What more is there to discuss?
