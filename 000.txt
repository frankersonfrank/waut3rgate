[Preface] I recorded a really long rant for r/biggestproblem and I can't find it. But I basically got angry that Dick was never mentioned and there was no closure for people who cared deeply about both co-hosts. I think I tweeted it to both Maddox and Dick but took it down quickly as Maddox listened to it right away.

[2016-06-05 03:22:40] <Maddox> Dude, that mp3 is pretty unprofessional
[2016-06-05 03:24:28] <Maddox> Of course I care about the fans, and you in particular. We've met in real life, I even sought you out to do the chip-tune intro for episodes on my show.
[2016-06-05 03:26:21] <Maddox> So this blind-sided me. The allegations that I don't care about fans because I don't respond to email is horse shit because first of all, I have 64,325 unread emails in my inbox and another 24,060 marked "important." That's on top of getting messages sent to me on Twitter, Instagram, Twitch and 5 different Facebook pages that I manage. And text messages to my cell phone. If I replied to even half of all the messages I received, that's all I'd have time for
[2016-06-05 03:31:31] <Maddox> Anyway man, it sucks that the podcast ended. But there's nothing I can do to explain what happened.
[2016-06-05 03:39:05] <Maddox> As for your fan-art, we've had private conversations at length, I've commented on your work and given you enthusiastic feedback about your music, and even re-tweeted your fan-art making fun of me. I don't know what else you want. Pretty disappointed you of all people--someone I made time to come see while I was working on set--would post something like this suggesting I don't care about the fans. Trust me, there's a good reason for everything. And nobody is entitled to an explanation. Yeah, it sucks, but it sucks for everyone, not just the fans. Hope you enjoyed the show while it lasted
[2016-06-05 03:47:39] <Maddox> I can't believe that you'd complain that I never brought in your fan art after I brought in so many of your sound clips, spoke to you personally and even posted a picture of us together on the website. I've brought in more of your work on the show than most fans. Guess you forgot to count all that
[2016-06-05 03:50:13] <Maddox> Pretty disappointing man.
[2016-06-05 03:51:07] <wauterboi> I clarified in the reddit that you brought in my "Another Universe" bit, and the point I was trying to make is he was very consistent at first about responding to emails and stuff like that.
[2016-06-05 03:52:58] <wauterboi> I met you in person and I really like the content you produce, and I really like the podcast, and I really like how cool you are to work for and how over time you have become very responsive and stuff like that, but with the last episode I really think there should have been some time spent on talking about Dick, whether it be as small as, "He couldn't make it, but he loved you guys", or really anything. You're a creative dude and someone that thinks things through most of the time, but I personally felt like the last episode wasn't utilized like it should have.
[2016-06-05 03:53:17] <Maddox> So what? That's because I get significantly more email. I don't have time to reply to everyone. Sorry man, that's just the way it is.
[2016-06-05 03:53:55] <Maddox> Dude, trust me, there was a reason for everything
[2016-06-05 03:54:02] <Maddox> Nobody is entitled to know
[2016-06-05 03:54:04] <wauterboi> I presented that fact in a way that I didn't necessarily mean to, I did kind of an extended rant and it wasn't my intention to paint you as completely non-responsive - what I was trying to do is say that Dick was the first one to notice me and really bring me to the podcast.
[2016-06-05 03:54:10] <Maddox> Things played out the way they did and it sucks, but leave it at that
[2016-06-05 03:54:47] <Maddox> DUDE. I POSTED A PICTURE OF US TOGETHER
[2016-06-05 03:55:09] <Maddox> How many other fans have I posted on the front page of the website?
[2016-06-05 03:55:18] <Maddox> I even hired you to do work for me
[2016-06-05 03:55:25] <Maddox> How much more do you want? Jesus
[2016-06-05 03:55:34] <wauterboi> Maddox, really quick
[2016-06-05 03:56:07] <wauterboi> I'm going to tell you that I'm an anxious person and I have a lot to say

[Note] I'm a huge baby here but at the time I really thought highly of Maddox and being told off like this was both unexpected and severely nervewracking. Also at the time, I spilled spaghetti on the regular as a socially inept pile of anxious flesh. So I didn't want to embarass myself.

[2016-06-05 03:56:15] <wauterboi> I'm going to take the post down
[2016-06-05 03:56:31] <Maddox> Good, it was a shitty thing to post about me
[2016-06-05 03:58:06] <wauterboi> Minus the inaccuracies derived from my tone, though, I really do think you should have given some time to speak about Dick. The point I was trying to make is that Dick cares about his fans, and really anything to say for him or about him would have been enough for me personally. I don't think that it's an entitled thing to ask for.
[2016-06-05 03:58:55] <wauterboi> And with all of the people that are trying to invade your privacy as well as Dick's, it's not right but it stems from the fact that the last episode was so abrupt without too much explanation - it just seemed like fans were the after thought.
[2016-06-05 03:59:22] <Maddox> I'm not going to comment about it. Nobody on the show is talking about it. I thought you of all people would be on my side and try to calm these idiotic conspiracy theories.
[2016-06-05 03:59:42] <wauterboi> Man, I feel sick to my stomach right now, but I've always held the idea that if you love something enough you'll criticize it because you want it to be better.
[2016-06-05 03:59:59] <Maddox> It's not going to be better. It's over.
[2016-06-05 04:00:09] <wauterboi> I'm talking about you - you're not over.
[2016-06-05 04:00:31] <Maddox> Dude, seriously... do you think this makes me happy?
[2016-06-05 04:00:32] <wauterboi> You're still a cool guy despite what I said, and I'm not ashamed to say that. I posted in the thread immediately after that meeting you in person was great.
[2016-06-05 04:00:51] <wauterboi> I think it's a complex situation that delves into a lot of emotions - I don't think you're happy about it.
[2016-06-05 04:01:02] <Maddox> Do you think I want to take a public beating like this? Honestly, stop and ask yourself if you were in my shoes.
[2016-06-05 04:01:07] <wauterboi> I don't really think that what happened was great, but it's just based on my imagination and no one has to tell me about it.
[2016-06-05 04:01:17] <Maddox> I'm seriously asking you, that's not a rhetorical question
[2016-06-05 04:01:36] <wauterboi> I don't think you want to take the beating.
[2016-06-05 04:01:48] <Maddox> Exactly
[2016-06-05 04:01:48] <wauterboi> And I don't think you wanted to be painted as someone that doesn't care about Dick.
[2016-06-05 04:02:01] <Maddox> So that means I must have a good reason not to talk about it, right?
[2016-06-05 04:02:15] <Maddox> Right?
[2016-06-05 04:02:33] <wauterboi> I don't think you have to talk about what happen so much as reference Dick at all
[2016-06-05 04:02:47] <wauterboi> My criticism wasn't that what happens behind doors should come out to the forefront.
[2016-06-05 04:03:06] <Maddox> Dude. Stop.
[2016-06-05 04:03:09] <Maddox> I don't owe anyone anything
[2016-06-05 04:04:04] <Maddox> There was a good reason things happened the way they did. That doesn't mean that the outcome was good. Nobody wanted to see this podcast end less than I did. It happened. Move on man... this is bullshit.
[2016-06-05 04:04:24] <wauterboi> You don't think it's weird at all to end the talk show without talking about the one other person that people listened for?
[2016-06-05 04:04:36] <wauterboi> Like, it doesn't have to be critical or in-depth. It doesn't have to be in context of the personal situation.
[2016-06-05 04:04:41] <Maddox> YES
[2016-06-05 04:04:47] <Maddox> No shit it's weird dude
[2016-06-05 04:05:04] <Maddox> But again, there's a reason everything happened the way it did
[2016-06-05 04:05:11] <Maddox> And no, you aren't owed an explanation
[2016-06-05 04:05:13] <Maddox> you aren't owed anything
[2016-06-05 04:05:16] <wauterboi> For me, and I can't speak for everyone, I would haven't perked an eyebrow if you just said, "Dick would be here if he could, but it's complicated. And he cares about you guys."
[2016-06-05 04:05:32] <wauterboi> Those two sentences would have been fine.
[2016-06-05 04:05:33] <Maddox> DUDE
[2016-06-05 04:05:40] <wauterboi> And it would have meant a lot.
[2016-06-05 04:05:58] <wauterboi> I don't want to piss you off, I really don't, but that's how I felt about it.
[2016-06-05 04:07:12] <Maddox> You need to read this: (not the defense of the shitty Ghostbusters movie, but the fan entitlement): http://www.avclub.com/article/ghostbusters-frozen-and-strange-entitlement-fan-cu-237139
[2016-06-05 04:10:38] <wauterboi> I'm thinking a lot right now about what I really did just now posting that and I don't want those negative consequences - I really didn't mean to provoke hurt or something like that. Really, the mentality that I had grown out of personal development and reading your writing for all of my life is that if you care about something, you should criticize it.
[2016-06-05 04:11:38] <wauterboi> I'm thinking about it and it was stupid for me to do, and I didn't want to cause a lynch mob to run after you - I was looking at it as a vent to get rid of what was bothering me off of my chest, and also because despite the issue that I took with the last episode, I did want things to get better.
[2016-06-05 04:13:01] <Maddox> Well no shit, who doesn't? Again, I'm not happy with the way things played out. There's a reason everything happened the way it did. No, I'm not going to tell you the reason. Nobody on the show is. And there's a good reason for that as well.
[2016-06-05 04:13:06] <wauterboi> While it's not supposed to be an important component of discussion that should change your mind, I'm shaking right now and trying to think clearly because I'm realizing what I'd done from a different perspective.
[2016-06-05 04:13:14] <wauterboi> I'm really sorry.
[2016-06-05 04:13:27] <wauterboi> And I really mean that - I don't know how to convey what I'm feeling right now.
[2016-06-05 04:13:51] <Maddox> I thought I'd have you in my court to try to dispel some of these idiotic myths and rumors, not to fuel them. It's rare that I take the time to talk to a fan like this, so it caught me by surprise that you'd post something like that. I considered you one of my biggest fans
[2016-06-05 04:14:21] <Maddox> Would you like to help?
[2016-06-05 04:14:41] <wauterboi> I don't know how.
[2016-06-05 04:14:47] <Maddox> I'll tell you
[2016-06-05 04:14:49] <wauterboi> What would you want for me to do?
[2016-06-05 04:17:17] <Maddox> Here's how you can help: just focus on the positive. This show touched a lot of people's lives. We all enjoyed it while it lasted. Lots of people were brought together and friendships were made over the years. It wasn't always smooth sailing, but sometimes partnerships go their separate ways and that's that. You can help by just being a calming force in the sea of vitriol. These rumors are all bullshit, people need to stop speculating and be more supportive of the people who brought you the content, not just whoever the forums like at the moment. I put in 10-12 hours per week on this podcast. More than anyone else on the show. I think that speaks volumes of how much I care about the fans. It really sucks that I'm getting beat up like this. A little bit of appreciation would be nice
[2016-06-05 04:18:13] <Maddox> I work hard to do what I do for a living. I put in countless hours bringing you guys content for free...
[2016-06-05 04:18:56] <Maddox> The new podcast will be different, but I can promise you this: I'm working just as hard to make it as good as possible. I just want to make good content for people.
[2016-06-05 04:20:42] <Maddox> Some people won't like it. Change is never easy. But it's sometimes necessary and we all have to accept it and move on. I'm just trying to do my best and deliver a kickass product. I hope people enjoy it. And if you don't, that's fine too, but please for the love of God, this entitlement has to stop. Nobody owes fans free entertainment, explanations, accounts of what happened or personal details about our lives
[2016-06-05 04:21:12] <Maddox> I'm just trying to do my best and I hope people like it
[2016-06-05 04:22:49] <wauterboi> In the first take that I did before scrapping it, I said, "I don't understand fandoms, for the most part. I'm generally annoyed by them. People think that because they obsess over consuming content that they deserve something for it without thinking that the content itself is all that's necessary."
[2016-06-05 04:24:42] <wauterboi> And up to this point I've said that and defended that statement, and I do think you work extremely hard to do the stuff you do. What I wanted to do was criticism, not attacking or demands for entitlement, and I really do apologize if it came off that way. I'm not a very good speaker. I've been working on it.
[2016-06-05 04:24:54] <wauterboi> *demands for fulfilling entitlement
[2016-06-05 04:26:04] <Maddox> I wish things played out differently. We all do. But sometimes life throws you a curve ball you weren't expecting and people go their separate ways. It'll be fine. Everything will go on just fine. Just stop and take a breather for a moment... look at that subreddit: it's 1400 or so people who are loud, angry and vitriolic. They all have one point of view and they sound like a chorus of angry people, but they're the small vocal minority
[2016-06-05 04:26:14] <Maddox> If you hang out there, you'll get the impression that everyone feels that way
[2016-06-05 04:26:33] <wauterboi> Oh, I thought that way even about the TBPITU website.
[2016-06-05 04:27:14] <wauterboi> And I think I recall avoiding that subreddit up to this point because it seemed like people who got banned from the site escaped there to just shit on everyone that went on
[2016-06-05 04:27:50] <Maddox> But I have 190,000 followers on Facebook, 30,000 on Twitter, 313,000 on YouTube, 25,000 on my personal Facebook and another 30-40,000 on all my other stuff. Those are the silent majority. They're not like these frothing idiots who have nothing better to do than to speculate about shit that doesn't matter at 4 AM. Be like the good guys. Don't add fuel to the fire. It's already awful. It needs a soothing salve more than anything. Not more inflamation
[2016-06-05 04:29:01] <wauterboi> I'll try not to.
[2016-06-05 04:29:08] <wauterboi> Are you still angry with me?
[2016-06-05 04:29:19] <Maddox> That subreddit will turn on you the second you have an opinion that doesn't match their hive-mind. They claim to be all about free speech, but only insofar as you agree with them. They're angry, bitter people. Don't be one of those losers. You're better than that man
[2016-06-05 04:29:40] <Maddox> Nah dude, we're good. It's all good
[2016-06-05 04:30:26] <Maddox> I just thought you'd be more in my court is all. I appreciate your support over the years. And I clearly have the most immense love of my fan base. I wouldn't be here without you guys, and that's why I work so hard to produce so much free content
[2016-06-05 04:30:36] <Maddox> I still don't have ads on my website for crying out loud
[2016-06-05 04:30:42] <Maddox> That means something
[2016-06-05 04:32:20] <Maddox> Sorry I couldn't explain any details, and sorry it didn't play out the way people wanted to. There's a very good reason for everything. We can't talk about that reason, but I hope people will still support whatever I do. I didn't do what I did to spite the fans.
[2016-06-05 04:33:32] <wauterboi> My brain feels really overloaded and I have too many things I want to say at once
[2016-06-05 04:34:15] <wauterboi> I've had anxiety issues all of my life and I've gotten very better with them over the years but this sent me into a little bit of a shock.
[2016-06-05 04:35:22] <Maddox> It'll be okay man, just try to breathe and take it easy
[2016-06-05 04:35:31] <wauterboi> Actually, speaking of anxiety, I have major recording anxiety, and the more I listened to the podcast the more I wish that I could be on it. I've actually been practicing a lot with recording myself because I want to make my own content and also because I wanted to be on the show and make more stuff for it.
[2016-06-05 04:35:39] <Maddox> Everything's cool
[2016-06-05 04:36:02] <Maddox> well your recording sounded smooth
[2016-06-05 04:36:17] <wauterboi> I wanted to be the guy that brings in a good first problem and then immediately nosedive and see how badly the podcast would explode if I brought in "Not enough female representation"
[2016-06-05 04:36:38] <wauterboi> That recording consists of probably over one hundred takes.
[2016-06-05 04:36:48] <wauterboi> In the span of two or three hours.
[2016-06-05 04:37:03] <wauterboi> Actually, that might be a little high - one to two hours.
[2016-06-05 04:38:02] <Maddox> yeah, and it was only 8-minutes long...
[2016-06-05 04:38:13] <Maddox> now imagine doing that for 90 minutes every week for 2 years
[2016-06-05 04:38:25] <Maddox> Lot of work, right?
[2016-06-05 04:38:34] <wauterboi> haha, yes.
[2016-06-05 04:42:57] <Maddox> You did that because you cared a lot about something you believed in, right?
[2016-06-05 04:43:09] <wauterboi> Absolutely.
[2016-06-05 04:43:22] <Maddox> You were willing to work for 2-3 hours making that 8-minute clip... that's passion. You don't get that kind of passion unless you really care, right?
[2016-06-05 04:43:45] <wauterboi> Yes.
[2016-06-05 04:43:57] <Maddox> I do that for 10-12 hours every week because I have passion
[2016-06-05 04:44:07] <Maddox> I want to make sure everything I put out is great for my fans
[2016-06-05 04:44:50] <Maddox> I do care about my fans. Quite a bit
[2016-06-05 04:44:51] <wauterboi> Does the negativity grate at you a lot?
[2016-06-05 04:44:59] <Maddox> I think it shows in what I do
[2016-06-05 04:45:53] <Maddox> well, it sucks, but I've been doing this for nearly 20 years. I've seen it before. I know it's a small vocal minority who don't have anything better to do right now. This needs to die down. The quicker the anger can be quelled, the better for everyone. People don't think rationally when they're angry
[2016-06-05 04:48:04] <Maddox> Again, I have over 500,000 fans across all my social media (313k + 190k + 25k + 30k+ 20k = 578k), so let's just be generous and say that all 1,400 people on this subreddit hate me. That's still only 0.2% of my fan base. Not even 1%
[2016-06-05 04:48:58] <Maddox> It's easy to think that they represent a majority of people because they're so loud, but they don't. It's not fair that they're trying to hijack this narrative. Trust me, there are two sides to every story and they're inventing a narrative about what happened that doesn't exist.
[2016-06-05 04:49:11] <wauterboi> Yeah, that's the gist that I get from a lot of the comments where you take a slightly liberal-oriented topic, i.e. the homeless housing thing
[2016-06-05 04:49:16] <wauterboi> Where people just comment, "is this a joke"
[2016-06-05 04:50:10] <wauterboi> Or sometimes a better example is something highly voted but a ton of very anti-liberal people hijacking the comments with a lot of hate.
[2016-06-05 04:50:42] <Maddox> Right, because they're zealots. They can't entertain a thought that doesn't fit their political point of view. They're hardcore Trump supporters who just want to jerk each other off and reaffirm their world-views rather than consider an idea outside their political ideology. And for the record, Homeless Housing happened in Utah, the most conservative state, and was created by a conservative
[2016-06-05 04:55:06] <wauterboi> This is a big steer off-topic, but if I were to go on a family road trip from Vegas across the coastline towards Washington and I were to stop in LA (the road trip isn't very concrete or anything), do you think we can hang out? I know you're a super busy dude, but I've always just wanted to talk and pick your brain.
[2016-06-05 04:55:12] <wauterboi> That's really all I ever want to do with people, honestly.
[2016-06-05 04:56:33] <wauterboi> I really wanted to meet Asterios while he was in LA too, shame he's not there anymore.
[2016-06-05 04:57:43] <Maddox> Depends on when, but I'm pretty much locked in until my book is done. I don't really go outside much anymore, but yeah it'd be cool to kick back and grab a beer some day
[2016-06-05 04:58:11] <Maddox> Between my writing schedule, youtube videos, twitch stream, book, podcast and all my other obligations, it's hard to come up for air sometimes
[2016-06-05 04:58:35] <Maddox> (and that's how I get 90,000 unread emails in my inbox hehe)
[2016-06-05 05:00:21] <wauterboi> Haha, sounds like me, except everything I do is just for me. I work on websites for people to make some cash on the side for college, and mess around with music every now and then for others, but I end up spending an infinite amount of hours working on music for no one really to hear
[2016-06-05 05:00:50] <Maddox> well send more my way, I'm a fan of your stuff
[2016-06-05 05:01:09] <Maddox> anyway man, it's late and I've gotta run, but I hope you're still not upset
[2016-06-05 05:01:30] <wauterboi> I'm not, I'm quite happy actually.
[2016-06-05 05:01:45] <Maddox> I know you still have some questions. We all do. Just believe me that there's a reason everything played out the way it did. It sucks and nobody is more disappointed about it than me
[2016-06-05 05:02:12] <wauterboi> I understand and apologize.
[2016-06-05 05:03:23] <Maddox> I wish there was more closure but it's the best we could do given the sudden ending and time frame we had
[2016-06-07 16:26:28] <wauterboi> Hey dude, I saw the last twitch stream after the fact and if you need extra help with kicking people who won't stop with the situation I can help out with that.
[2016-06-07 18:27:36] <Maddox> Thanks buddy
[2016-06-07 18:28:00] <Maddox> I also saw your reddit post, that was nice of you. Much appreciated
[2016-06-07 20:11:17] <wauterboi> Yeah, no problem.
